# ðŸ§  Gender Prediction Using Text (NLP Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on **predicting gender (Male/Female)** based solely on text data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. It employs traditional vectorization (TF-IDF) and machine learning classifiers like **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to achieve accurate classification results.

Additionally, a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using `Tkinter` allows users to input text and view gender predictions and sentiment analysis in real-time.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Extract meaningful features from text using **TF-IDF**
- Train and compare multiple classifiers
- Identify the best-performing model
- Build a GUI-based application for real-time predictions
- Include sentiment analysis for additional context

ðŸ§ª Model Training & Evaluation
Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Based on the results, Linear SVM performed the best.

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.7165	0.7210	0.6978	0.7092
Naive Bayes	0.6882	0.6619	0.7577	0.7065
Linear SVM (Best)	0.7229	0.7246	0.7107	0.7176

âœ… Best Model: Linear SVM based on F1-score
