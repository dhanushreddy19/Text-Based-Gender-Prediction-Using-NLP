"        1 Corinthians 5:11 'But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner - not even to eat with such a person.'   Sounds somewhat simple now, right?  Wrong.  Applying this verse to my life is very hard.  My sister fits these things and now I need to figure out how to be obedient to this.  How much time is it okay to spend with her?  Are my parents supposed to ostricize her out of the family?  I don't know.  My uncle mostly, and also my cousins, probably claim to many people that they are Christians, yet they are drunks.  Am I not to go to any family functions?  Am I supposed to be like my Grandad and just pretend like it's not going on?  This is what I am going to seek out.         ",female
"       Having moved to Jersey City nearly a month ago, I had no idea that I would be packing up to camp out in my original homeland, the Philippines. Well, perhaps my homeland away from homeland...in New Jersey. Familiarizing myself with the new neighborhood, I strolled down West Side Avenue and was dumbfounded to see the large wooden sign overhead the local store with the carved lettering, Filipinas Market. Wait, that's Me. I'm a Filipina. I even have perfume called Filipina. The extraordinary woman who arranged my adoption back in 1980 gave it to me a few years ago for my birthday. I only use it on special occasions, hoping to make it last until the bottle is bone dry. And even then, it's like the puny little puddle of molasses like shampoo that might take days to finally ooze out, but if you add a little water and shake it up like a martini, voila, you have yourself watered down, bubbly, yet officially usable shampoo.  When I first started riding the bus to the path station, I found myself surrounded by distant relatives and familiar faces. And my nose! When I was young, some kids would ask my why my nose was flatter than theirs. It never bothered me, I was used to it, and as a tomboy, I could beat up the biggest boy in my class. In fact, up until high school I was known for being able to throw the ball farther than all the boys. OK, now I'm just bragging. But I would usually shrug off their perfectly innocent question and resume digging in the dirt, looking for gold using a twig.   When I was 14, my parents took me back to the Philippines, which allowed me to embrace the culture and to see my heritage. Granted, I was at the age where it was embarrassing to be seen with your parents and especially agitating when you have to wear a fanny pack, but it wasn't difficult to see that the Filipino people embraced a sweet demeanor and donned warm smiles. That would explain why I got the rep for 'Always Smiling,' in my 8th grade year book. I had to change schools after that, since every moment after that, when I did not display the freeze frame all whites Crest smile, people asked if I was OK. Recently, I have acquired more of a 'Don't mess with me, on subway, walking or anywhere look,' for city life though.  Waiting for the bus this morning, I met a woman, who knew from Adam and Eve that I was Filipino. She didn't believe that I worked in Manhattan, telling me the dreaded, 'you look like your still in high school...' tell me something I don't know. I tried to explain that I was from Connecticut but I think she may have been slightly confused. She was sweeter than a butter cookie and she made me feel right at home.          ",female

"             The most hilarious movie I have seen this year.. a comedy movie with absolutely no trace of slapstick. (When was the last time Hollywood came up with a pure comedy?) The catch: the movie is in French, the subtitles can capture only so much of the essence of the dialogues.  It revolves around a tiny fishing village in Quebec, where the only job for men is to go and collect weekly welfare checks. A completely dull and dreary existence. Their lives takes a new turn when they come to know that a small industry is considering their village for a plant. That means employment for all the youth. But there is only one thing they lack: they need to find a permanent residing doctor for the village. They send out 'brochures' on their village to all doctors in Montreal. One urbane doctor bites and decides to check out the village to escape a traffic offense (didnt really understand that part). He loves cricket, and the villagers have no clue what 'cricket' is. With the help of internet and&nbsp; a Lagaan-type song, they end up creating costumes, a make-shift 'stadium' and bats from oars. Now the doctor comes to visit and he is shocked to see men clad in cricket costumes at a distance. He insists he wants to watch the match. Poor villagers have no clue how the game is played. Suddenly a wise man comes up with a brilliant idea and he starts jumping up and down saying he won the match. Everybody follows. The poor doctor is shocked that both sides seem to have won but leaves the game anyways, bedazzled.  Such hilarious sequences fill the movie. The game of seduction for a young doctor, by a whole village. The film sure deserves the box office success it enjoyed in Canada (the second highest-grosser of all time).  &nbsp;           ",female
"              Short of being attached to the bumper of a pickup truck by a cock ring and being dragged around the 'great' state of Texas, I can't think of anything more painful than watching 'The Sweetest Thing,' which signals the end of Cameron Diaz's sanity, if not her career.  As far as I'm concerned, a great career move for Matthew Lillard would be decapitation.  Does anybody want to see Norm Macdonald in anything? At all? I'd like to see somebody toss him into the gorilla cage at the zoo and see how funny he can be. He screams 'actor' with the same conviction with which Richard Simmons screams 'straight.'  It appears that James Van Der Beek has spent the post-Dawson's Creek years receiving electroshock therapy.  In 'Mr. Wrong,' director Nick Castle combines two things that don't go together: romantic comedy and an episode of Bugs Bunny. After directing this and the awful 'Major Payne,' I think Nick should be required to sit in on all the screenings of his next movie and take questions afterward, such as this one: 'Can I beat the shit out of you in the parking lot, or should we get it over with here?'  Vertical Limit: . Climb, climb, climb, avalanche, climb, climb, Nitro-Glycerin explosion, climb, climb, awful dialogue, climb, climb, helicopter, climb, climb, cool action scenes that were shown to death in the previews, climb, climb, random death, climb, climb, credits. I just saved you 7 bucks.  I've always contended that Chris O'Donnell has the screen presence of a fried egg, and his performance here has done nothing to change my mind. Also on hand to humiliate himself is the formerly reliable actor Scott Glenn, who plays a gruff old mountain man looks like he's made of burlap. But the true standout of the cast is Robin Tunney. If there is a more vacuous and vacant actress currently alive in this world, then I'm Fred Gwynne. From her roles in The Craft to End of Days to Supernova, she is consistently and irretrievably awful. In Vertical Limit, she plays a climbing expert (excuse me while I snort Pepsi out of my nose) who spends the entire movie literally freezing to death, and Tunney can't even blow a nasal snot bubble convincingly.  Whoever thought Matthew Lillard should do Shakespeare has severe brain lesions. Whoever thought Alicia Silverstone should sing on camera is on drugs I never knew existed.   I feel bad for Jean-Claude Van Damme's proctologist. If his acting is any indication, it must take a lot of time and several hydraulic tools to get that guy's ass cheeks to separate. He walks around like he's some kind of frozen treat: Jean-Claude on a stick. You could sharpen a pencil if you got close enough to jam one into his rear end. The only thing stiffer than the guy's strut is his personality, which has all the flexibility of Margaret Thatcher at a rave after five double espressos.  This film is so bad that it actually casts doubt on the significance of Dylan's music career, because anybody whose soul is full of this much pretentious bullshit would barely be able to hold his own in a karaoke bar. If you didn't know that Dylan was more full of himself than a naked Tommy Lee on a heroin binge, you're about to learn.  Now, I don't know if they were paying Isabella Miko by the word or what, but all she does is scream and run around topless at the slightest provocation. I'm not sure this qualifies as acting so much as appropriate Hollywood party behavior, which may explain how Isabella got discovered.  Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy have better chemistry than Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Besides, Zeta-Jones could give Melanie Griffith a run for the 'Please Stop Acting Before I Choke on My Own Tongue' award. She plays the part like a 15-year-old who's just learned she isn't getting the Beemer for her sixteenth birthday.  I'm going to find Ted Danson and kick his ass for not beaning Shelly Long with a shot glass during 'Cheers' and eliminating that particular Hollywood plague at the source. The fact that the film studios haven't figured out yet that Shelly Long shouldn't be allowed in any more motion pictures is reason enough to hope for a massive earthquake that sends Hollywood to the bottom of the ocean floor.  The Corporation seems like the brainchild of 3 movie execs who aim to conceive a movie while completely high on marijuana. How’s THIS for a recipe? ”We take The Firm, that Cruise flick that’s ripped off more often than a hotel bathrobe, mix it with something old like The Stepford Wives, throw in a few pointless sex scenes, hire one of those 90210 freaks, and get Roger Corman to sign the check! Andrew Stevens will direct. He’d direct rush hour traffic for two donuts and cab fare. Oh, and call the Mom from ET. We need someone to overact and humiliate themselves badly.” ”Which 90210 kid? The short little Michael J. Fox clone, or the tall brooding James Dean wannabe?” ”No, I was thinking that bland lifeless blonde one! The one that’s NEVER BEEN IN A MOVIE before!” ”Ian Ziering???” Does he have an agent? Does he even have a phone?”  Speaking of stupid, has anyone else noticed that Tara Reid is so artificially tan that she looks like one of the Oompah-Loompahs from 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.' Her eyes appear so freakishly bright because of her unnatural skin tone that even when I close my eyes now, I can see the spots burned into my retinas.  The director of this movie is David Zucker, the guy who made 'Airplane.' It's hard to imagine what this guy has done to himself in the last couple of decades to become so unfunny, but my guess is that it probably involved Christian Science and LSD.  Here's the exact moment when I knew 'Die Another Day,' the 20th James Bond film, was going to get nuked: Madonna's cameo appearance. And it's not like the woman just walks across the screen and you say, 'Oh look, its Madonna.' No, she has a speaking part with actual full sentences. I don't know where the definition of 'kiss of death' is in the Hollywood lexicon but 'Madonna has a speaking part' is an indication that you're getting close. This woman couldn't be stiffer if she had an icicle in her rectum.   Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this film, which means twice the failure. Her direction reminded me of her acting in 'Godfather 3,' a performance that had every critic in America pondering whether she'd look better in a Burger King or a McDonald's uniform.   New tagline for marketing campaign: 'Better than 'Gigli'!'  Forget the 'Saturday Night Live' curse; how about the 'Friends' curse? Death would seem a welcome release compared to a life of starring roles in such gems as 'Ed', 'The Pallbearer' and 'Fools rush in.' Memo to Matthew Perry (and all the 'Friends' for that matter): more Vicadin, not less.   Putting Winona Ryder in an action thriller like 'Alien' makes about as much sense as letting Marlon Brando lead a Jazzercise video. Her character is about as interesting as a pound of alien dung.  Never mind that casting Ben Affleck as a street tough and Jennifer Lopez as a lesbian stretches believability more than casting John Goodman as Peter Pan. Welcome to Hollywood and the Anne Heche-ization of lesbianism. Not only is lesbianism a transitory sexual preference, to be waved around like a Chanel purse, but it's also a great marketing tool!  I just can't emphasize enough how bad it all is. I mean, it's such a disaster it may resurrect Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs' career. He'll be able to defend himself by saying 'at least I didn't make 'Battlefield Earth',' and executives will have to acknowledge that he has a point.   'Bad Boys 2' is a 150-minute life-sucking experience. It's like that scene in 'The Princess Bride' where Prince Humperdink turns the machine up to '50' and sucks 50 years of Wesley's life away.   I don't know where anybody got the idea that Chris Rock could act, but the guy is making about as much progress in his new career as Corey Feldman is as a pop singer.   Since I can do no public service by discussing this film, I'd like to offer some guidelines for filmmakers who consider endeavors of this nature in the future.  1.No more film adaptations of bad American sitcoms.  2.Should, by some oversight, such a film adaptation be made, original cast members may not appear in them -- not even in a pathetic 'hey look, that guy is still alive' cameo.  3.If such a film lasts longer than 85 minutes, the filmmakers shall be considered to be in violation of the audience's basic human rights.  4.Producers are prohibited from casting any of the following people in a speaking role: Tom Arnold, Jim Varney, Ed Begley, Jr., any current or former cast member from Saturday Night Live, any person who was part of the '80s Brat Pack, any member of the Sheen or Baldwin families, Fran Drescher, Florence Henderson and Shelly Long. Especially Shelly Long.  Any violation of above rules will result in the filmmaker's compulsory attendance at next year's Academy Awards ceremony, where he will have his head chopped off onstage in a gala musical tribute to mediocrity.

"           Hi Hi Hi. Well today I accompanied my friend Sarah job hunting, she's so fussy though! She can't work saturdays cos she dances, she can't do after school because she dances, so basically she wants a holiday job that lets her leave at 3.30 everyday, and no weekends. hmmm. We started off in Hamsey Green, but no luck their, just a lot of application forms. We then walked down to sanderstead and we thought we'd got osme luck cos there was s sign in the bakers, but they said they'd already filled it, they just hadn't bothered to take the sign down! So no luck in the rest of the shops in Sanderstead, so we hopped on a bus into Croydon. Clarks said they take on holiday people which was good so we collected a form, and Clintons had a vacancy but it included a Saturday, so no luck. every other shop (Marks, BHS, Alders, HMV, Virgin, Waterstones etc etc) said they haven't got any vacancies till August/October/Christmas. Fun. So we then walked out of Croydon along the Brighton Road to go to 2 music shops, and no luck either! Collapsed into a bus stop on the Brighton Road, looked up and saw a restaurant had a sign in the window advertising for waiters/waitresses, so we went in as a last resort, cos she could do that as it would be evenings! The people in there were so nice and I got a free drink while I waited for her so I was happy after a long day! She got a trial, and then the bloke told me I could aswell! So we're both trainee Waitresses now, lol! Very strange day. Went all round the world, ended up with a job I didn't know I wanted, and then spent the rest of the afternoon in Selsdon Primary photocopying log books from 1955.  Can't be assed to go to IT cos I went yesterday and it was pants, so I'm going to do some revision of my own. Perhaps. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?!         ",male

Basically due to the kind of atmosphere and design process, the learning style would be one-on-one, which means the student would be able to emphasize his own needs, therefore stating it into a student-centered learning, and at the same time the student would be able to pace in his own speed, and he dosen't need to adjust anymore to the irregular pace of the classroom. The students would be able to provide the learnings and knowledge on lessons that they like to learn with, not some courses that they find appealingless to them. The lessons to them will have application due to the exercises, simulations and quizzes given to them. The system would be able to adjust itself to the learning style of the student. Learning would be essential on the part of the learner since he would be able to track his learning due to the save/load feature, and therefore follow his improvements.

"        Poker has been good to me so far, without being overly nice. Had a good run in a few tournaments, top 20 finishes but still no money. Had a great hand on Aloha when severely short stacked against chip leader early on, went all in pre-flop with Qc4c against AhKh. Flop came Th 4h 4s, turn 4d and the 2h river. Always nice to beat the leader at the table when he has a good hand, but really with felt like that it is just begging for a boat. I don't know if I've said this before, but man I love Quads. Bit of a silly thing to say really - I'm sure everyone loves four of a kind. But for me it is a bit like having your point guard dunking on their center. Can anybody out their remember KJ dunking over Olujuwon? Now there is some contemporary/old school basketball references for you.  I feel a need to comment on a very important aspect of the online poker game - The name you choose to be represented by. The name you select means a lot about you as a player (Huh?), and really can determine if you win or lose (just go with me here.). The names chosen at any poker site fall generally into one of the following categories, and I give my apologies in advance for my lame attempt at l33t for I am no match for the real l33t poker names out there:   1 - 'Local Tourism Board'   Completely made up examples include: 'OhioMan', 'NYPoker', 'JerseyBadMan'.  The 'LTB' player needs to tell people where they were born, are currently living or recently received a wrongfully addressed post card from. There is a sub-division for players who choose to use their college to define their name, even though they dropped out freshman year in 1984. Just how specific they are varies from national monikers (Non-US only, mostly Canadian), state-wide (Mostly US), to the local small one horse town that recently got the Interweb thingy hooked on up. The reason why US players choose state-wide as opposed to a national identity is because they believe that since they exist, it must naturally be assumed that they are from America (the fact that the state they mention is an American state can be ignored for the sake of my argument.). This is deeply entrenched in their genes from an early age, where they watch the 'World Series' being played out by only American teams. Canada has a law where any Canadian person who is likely to come into contact with people from a country other than the US must at all times remind those foreign people that they are Canadian and NOT American. This goes for real life as well as in poker rooms. The 'LTB' player is likely to loose all their chips.   2. 'Poker Terms'   Completely made up examples include: 'PocketAces', 'RiverMan', 'Foldme', 'QueensFull'.  The poker terms player likes to hide their true identity behind any random poker term they find on any poker medium available. Favorite among this all too popular breed are 'pocket' anything. It has been proven by The Greater Univeristy of Poker in North-West Dubbo that by naming yourself after a good starting hand will fool 43.765% of professional players into thinking you have that starting hand on most occasions. The number increases when the hands become higher ( 'PocketKings' = 74.218% and 'BigSlick' = 66.667%). The unfortunately reality of the results of the study from the Greater Univeristy of Poker in North-West Dubbo is that their credibility has been shot to pieces ever since they recommended the best way to win lotto was birthdays. The 'Poker Terms' player is also an expert on all things poker, and as the name suggests they will throw in any poker term they can at any time no matter if it fits or not. Please see example below.   PocketAces:  Ha! Bet you didn't see my boat coming down the river with the cowboys doing the paddling!  RiverMan:  Yeah, but my bullets and hammer UTG sucked out your runner-runner over pair!  PocketAces:  But my button burst your bubble on spades full of broadway with crabs kicker on the blind!  RiverMan:  N00b.  They hate anybody who mentions the movie 'Rounders', and thinks ESPN ruined the true, pure poker that they play. If you beat them it was luck, if they win it was skill. The 'Poker Terms' player is likely to loose all their chips.    3. 'I'm Famous!'    Completely made up examples: 'U5h3r', 'Tr1ppl3HHH18', 'SlimShady', 'DustinDiamond4EVA'.  On rare occasions, the 'I'm Famous' player attempt to convince the rest of the table that they are in fact who their names says they are. While maybe the odd celebrity may try their hand at poker every now and then, I find it hard to believe that they would spend a few hours online trying to win $29.66 (with the exception of Dustin Diamond perhaps. Hey, Screech gotta eat you know.). This is seen as really pathetic, especially when 'BigGuy1955' tries to hit on 'BritneyGurl' and asking if she could show some more skin in her next film clip.(this is of course not confined to online poker.). When the 'I'm famous' player is not trying to impersonate any random celebrity but just honoring them by name, all seems well...That is, until 'SlimShady' sits at the same table as 'R34LSlim' - and nobody stands up no matter how politely you ask and it is best to turn off chat immediately. The 'I'm famous' player is likely to loose all their chips.   4. 'It's Me'.   Completely made up examples include: 'BarrySmith', 'JoyceUK', 'Henry21', 'FitFrank69'.  'It's Me' players really don't understand what the Internet is for, and that is hiding behind an online persona and never letting on to who you relly are. They have chosen a name that even the Boulder City Police could decipher (Jay Leno would be so proud of me right now). With no imagination evident, you can guarantee the 'It's Me' player will either see every single flop just to make sure their 72o is no good, or they will fold everything that isn't pocket aces. When ever anybody wins a hand - no matter in what fashion - they are sure to post 'nh' in the chat box, and give you a 'gg' when they finally loose their stack. When playing against an 'it's Me' player, you must never post anything similar to them, as it will start a never ending run of constanants the likes of Wheel of Fortune only dreams about. See example below:   BarrySmith:  gl all.  JoyceUK : TY.U2.  BarrySmith:  lol. vnh.  JoyceUK:  ROFL :)  BarrySmith:  ty. asl?  JoyceUK:  U BBQ?  BarrySmith:  udg fgrt qzxc?  JoyceUK:  IOU SAD VCR DVD FUBAR.  And on it goes. Do not enter into any discussion about important shit, because it is guaranteed that the 'It's Me' player has a world of experience and an opinion on every matter that your tender years could not understand. This does not include poker, even though they will tell you what you should have done all the time regardless if you won or not. The 'It's Me' player will loose all their chips.   5. 'l33t'.

The have studied the 'shift' key for hours, and experimented with 'crtl' and breifly 'alt', and is even prone to binges of 'Caps Lock'. You are a 'n00b' if you are sitting on the same table as them and dare to speak. Similar to the 'Poker Terms' player, if they beat you then you have been '0wn3d', you stupid fucking noob you. If you beat them, it is because they are so damn drunk right now (they're not). He knows that this poker site is fixed and he has proof (he doesn't). You may beat him but he was on fire last night when he won $10K at the bigger limit tables, he is just slumming it on these tables you are on because he is bored and still so damn drunk (they're still not). The 'leet' will loose all their chips.  Well, there you have it. Try and spot as many of these as you can in your next poker room and already you will have the advantage.  Off the topic of poker, I'm pretty stoked to be going to see the Australian Premier of 'Walking Tall' later this week, and even happier about the fact that The Rock will be there in person. He has been doing all the usual media spots aorund Oz at the moment and is good to listen to.

Na verdade o que fazia coisas simples tao especiais era o pessoal reunido. Era ver quem conseguia cantar 'Faroeste Cabloco' sem tropecar. E cantar muita brega bem alto. Era ver fotos e contas historias engracadas de um verao passado. Desse pessoal poucos restaram, e os que restaram tomaram rumos diferentes. Tao diferentes que seria dificil reagrupar.

"       BAGHDAD, Iraq - A group loyal to insurgency leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi threatened Friday to execute two Bulgarian hostages if the U.S. military did not release all Iraqi detainees within 24 hours, according to a videotape broadcast on the Al-Jazeera television station.   The Tawhid and Jihad group sent Al-Jazeera a video showing the two unidentified Bulgarians sitting with their hands cuffed, flanked by three masked men, two carrying rifles and one carrying a rocket propelled grenade launcher. On the wall behind them was their group's black flag with a golden circle.   One of the men read a statement, though his voice could not be heard. Al-Jazeera's newsreader said the group demanded the release of all Iraqi detainees within 24 hours.   The group had previously claimed responsibility for the beheading of U.S. businessman Nicholas Berg and South Korean translator Kim Sun-il. It was also believed to be behind a series of attacks on police and security forces in Iraq (news - web sites) that killed 100 people in the days leading up to the coalition forces' handover of power to an Iraqi interim government last month.   An editor at Al-Jazeera's newsroom in Doha said the channel received the tape Thursday.  --When will these morons learn it's not going to work. Terrorism doesn't work on us or our allies. (with exception to Spain, El Salvador and Honduras) The coalition is strong. Their will is stronger than some terrorists that have a radical agenda for jihad.   Andrew B.     ",male
"                 I was just watching Michael Moore's documentary, 'Bowling for Columbine.' He's seeking to understand why the U.S. is such a violent country. He examines various reasons that people often gives: video games, violent movies, music lyrics, guns, etc. The most intriguing part is when he interviews various Canadians. Any reason for America's violence that you give, it seems, doesn't make sense when compared with Canada. For example, Canadians play video games, watch violent movies, listen to the same kind of music, and own lots and lots of guns, but very few people get murdered by guns in a year. The clips imply that America's culture of fear is at least partly to blame. For example, Canadians are so relaxed, don't lock their doors, yet have less violent crime (although the people he interviewed did admit that burglars have broken into their homes to steal things). I wonder what sociologists have to say about all this.      ",male

"       Stormed like mad last night.    All day clouds were parked over northeast Kansas, turning the weather all gray and sticky and foreboding.  Everyone I talked to said they felt something coming.  Since nothing much ever happens here, the local news was having a fit about it, throwing up pictures of radar and safety warnings and recorded calls of old ladies reporting possible twisting formations they saw from their kitchen windows.  A tornado can kill you.  It can take away your possessions.  It can pull down the walls around you but leave your cup unspilled on your coffee table.  But all we got was rain, which in some perverse way disappointed me.  I want to be stripped of everything sometimes.  I am poor with day to day trivialities and I am slightly socially inept-- I am not punctual.  But I am good in  danger.    It rained harder than it has in years.  The last time it rained like that was the year I ran away from home, can it really be six years ago?  I remember at the time I thought it was a sign.  (I have always been strangely religious for an atheist.)  It rained until the streets looked like rivers.  It was practically Biblical.  I moved here with my best friends from my hometown, and we always did bizarre things just to be doing bizarre things.  It rained so much that we gave up on being dry and just walked around outdoors in our bathing suits.  I was lonesome and estranged from my family, and I was officially a high school dropout.  If I stopped being silly long enough to acknowledge these facts, I would feel a big windy hole in my chest.  (And thunder ripping above me all the while.)  But in the end the sun came out.  I am sure I missed out on a lot of good things in doing what I did, but since I'll never know what I missed, I feel fine.  (The road not taken, I suppose.)  My man was acting kind of weird last night.  We made cookies for my roommate, which was a disaster and not even worth the headache...We had to leave some of them in the oven while we helped contain our friend's cats and hide out while the storm was on.  They turned hard and brown in our absence.  And then she came home-- No love there, we're still in the doghouse for reasons I am losing patience with.    But my man...I thought something was wrong and it made me nervous.  We drove about in the rain, and when we hit campus, I started getting nostalgic about the last time we had a good rain.  I said, Let's go outside!  And there we were, running knee deep through rainwater, with cold drops pelting us so I couldn't stop shrieking from the excitement.  Lightning lit up the sky.  I hope nothing's wrong.  I hope it's not, because in spite of myself, I am all tangled up.  In ways, love is like letting someone hold a blade to your throat.  I have to believe he won't cut me.  But even the slightest thing makes me worry that he will.  I know I am wrong, and that it's probably nothing, and it's unfair to make him pay for what others have done to me.  Gun-shy girl slept alone last night.  Today begins my project of self denial.  I put it so dramatically, but the bottom line is I am going on a diet.  I ate my hundred calories this morning and I packed my apple for lunch...I felt so miserable and the hunger pains haven't even started yet.  But I've put on a few and I've been wearing big fat man's pants and the last time I saw a photograph of myself, I said 'Who the hell is that?  So it begins today...    ",female

"       Today was certainly not the ideal day off. It was pretty icky.  I started feeling a little sick last night, but it wasn't that bad so I just went to be early to try to sleep it off. So this morning my mom offered to take me out to lunch, which is always loads of fun, so we went. It was pretty nice - we went to the Rockford. I love that place. Afterwards, we decided to go to the mall to pick up my glasses. Finally. So we got there and started looking at the el cheapo ones because my dad wants me to try those first. The woman I went to for my prescription basically told me that even a prescription wouldn't help me because it's some funky teenage thing that I'll eventually outgrow. So basically I'm supposed to have a permanent migraine from now until after college. Great. My mom told me, though, that if I didn't like the cheap ones that we could try the prescription just in case. So I started looking through the cheap ones and first of all, they just magnify things, they don't help my problem, and second, they don't come all the way up on your eyes so you have to cock your head back to do any kind of computer work. I couldn't stand them, so I said that we should just try the prescription because my head is killing me. Conveniently enough, my mother left the prescription at home. Lovely. So now I'm tired, have a fever, and I still don't have my glasses. This is when my mom decided she wants to go blouse shopping with me. So we look around and, of course, don't find anything as usual. It was still another hour or so before we could go pick up my sister and go home, so my mom offered to take us to a coffee shop to wait. We got in the car and drove to the cafe. When we got there, my mom saw that there was a new camera store next door, so she sent me to get her drink and then come back. I waited in that camera store for what felt like forever with nowhere to sit down and nothing to do. I started feeling sick to my stomach because the air in there was kind of weird.

"   I think I finally found what I'm looking for, or at least pinpointed the goal I'm trying to reach.  Our pastor talked about yearning for an 'indestructible well-bring of soul' in his message last night, and I think that this is exactly what I've been trying to find.  He used this phrase as a definition of joy, but I think it has so many more meanings to it - joy, contentment, belonging, righteousness, and so many other qualities are wrapped up in the concept of 'well-being.'  I think that I had this at one time, but I know I don't have it now - my soul feels fragile like an egg-shell, cowering in the corner from all the beatings and bruises its taken (i.e. disappointments, etc.).  All I'm looking for, hoping for, praying for is someone who would actually come alongside me and help me, challenge me, prod me towards the path I need to be on - but of course, this has been a hope for several years now, and I've pretty much given up all hope of it actually happening.  Sometimes I just want to scream during church or when I'm with my Christian friends or something, ask what it is about me that makes people so indifferent about my spiritual well-being.  Is it that I'm too passive?  Seemingly too good (well, I could clear up that misconception real quick...)?  Don't seem to have any problems?  Too 'weird,' too caught up in the metaphysical aspects of things?  Not committed enough?  Whatever the reason, I just wish that someone would actually care...but I'm not holding my breath. ",male

"   My Family and Jesse James  I am the family's resident genealogist. I am aware of how many times I am my own cousin. Big deal. The royals did it, we did it, oh well. Appalachian Royalty has a certain twang and we don't have one eye in the middle of our forehead or hemophilia.   There is a family story, passed on by my Great-Great-Grandmother Julie (Ma-Ma's side). Now G-G-Grandma Julie was about the same age as my Great-Grandmother on my Pa-Pa's side, so she wasn't really THAT old in relation to the rest. She did live to see great-great grandchildren born, just like my Pa-Pa.   The story is that Julie lived with her mother in Pikeville, KY in the late 1800's. Supposedly, her mother ran a boardinghouse in the area, Jesse James stayed there, or rather they hid him while on the lam, and he tipped my g-g-grandmother $50 for bringing him a meal. Now, I'm inclined to believe it was $5 which probably seemed like $50 as she said she was 6 or 7 years old at the time.   Other family genes have discounted this story because supposedly Jesse James was not in that area at the time. Julie was not the type to make up stories of that nature so I was leaning toward Julie. (Now, I never knew her personally, I'm only going on the character reference of my grandfather and grandmother) I dug around and dug around in archives and such looking for clues to Jesse James whereabouts during this time frame.   Finally, I found what I was looking for. I was reading stories on www.crimelibrary.com.  Its my thing. Yes, I read about serial killers and the mob and outlaws. It serves me well. They have a section on Jesse James which is fairly long and involved written by a Civil War buff and BOOYAH! There it is in black and white... he went through KY in August of 1876. Julie would have been 6 or 7 years old at the time as she was born in August 1869. My family were conferedate sympathizers, even though they all deserted, and in old stories were linked to Quantrill's Raiders.   This doesn't prove that Jesse James and my g-g-grandmother ever crossed paths. But it doesn't disprove it either. I'm naturally more inclined to believe the family story, with a grain of salt, that we aided and abetted one of the most notorious outlaws ever. I'm so proud...sniff... does anyone have a tissue?

"        A Little of the Old In and Out    In :  Rena Xu , who writes for  urlLink Monday's Harvard Crimson :  ' Carrie Bradshaw , heroine of TVs  urlLink Sex and the City , famously remarked in the episode where she models for a New York fashion show, 'When I was broke sometimes I would buy  urlLink Vogue  instead of food. I felt it fed me more.'  'As I recently perused my own copy of Vogue over a meal in Annenberg, it struck me that almost every female body featured in the magazine looked as if it had perhaps skipped one too many meals. Of course, this was no novel discoverythe endless pages of endless legs were little surprise. After all, models are almost always expected to fit an unhealthily tall and skinny image. What was surprising, however, was the fact that the pictures of impossibly thin, bikini-clad models appeared just pages away from an article discussing the serious battle against anorexia and bulimia fought by one of the most prominent of these models ...'  Bravo.   Out :  Graydon Carter , beeyatch. The  urlLink oily Vanity Fair editor  has indeed  urlLink become everything he once detested  when he was a clear-eyed and writer in Spy Magazine, after a childhood yearnings of WASP writerly glamour back in  la Canada , eh? Does it really matter that  urlLink Graydon  has done gone and  sold his ass ?  Certainly it does. And  urlLink my nemesis Toby Young  gets it just about right:  'Well, as someone who worked for  Vanity Fair  from 1995 to 1998, I think it does matter. When I first met Graydon in 1993, he was in the pupae stage of his metamorphosis. He'd left Spy two years earlier ( urlLink the New York Observer  came in between), but hadn't quite settled into his new role. He tried to give the impression that, despite being the captain of this Conde Nast flagship, he remembered what it was like to be a pirate. Two years later, when I became a contributing editor, Graydon still prided himself on not being for sale. He was contemptuous of the publicists who clamored for his attention and urged his staff to put all press releases in 'the circular file.' He made it a point of principle that Vanity Fair, unlike other, lesser magazines, did not grant celebrities copy approval. He encouraged his writers to remain slightly aloof from the world they were covering.  'There were compromises, of course. Sometimes, to gain access to a big star, he had to strike a deal with a publicist and promise to include a less well-known client in the magazine. This D-lister would then appear on the front page of the Vanities section, a slot referred to by the staff as 'blond bimbos on the horizon.'  'But it would have been impossible to edit the magazine without coming to some accommodations with the PR machine. Within these limits, Graydon did his utmost to preserve the independence of the magazine. He knew he was on the losing side in the battle against the culture of celebrity, but he wasn't about to surrender.  'Now, however, he's in thrall to the voodoo priests and priestesses of the entertainment industry, and Vanity Fair is no more tough-minded than any other glossy magazine. The most embarrassing detail of last week's story was that Graydon recently tried to set up meetings at a number of Hollywood studios to pitch the idea of a movie based on a  Vanity Fair  article by  urlLink Nancy Jo Sales , with himself as a producer. (Graydon had stuck a toe in the water when he was one of the producers of the Robert Evans documentary  urlLink 'The Kid Stays in the Picture.')  Despite the best efforts of his agent, however, only one studio granted him an audience--and passed.  'As the co-founder and co-editor of  urlLink Spy , not to mention an outstanding editor in chief of Vanity Fair for more than a decade, Graydon Carter was a giant in journalism. If he had traded in his professional integrity to become the head of a studio, or even for a three-picture deal, that would have been one thing. But he has sacrificed his reputation to become just another hustler scratching around for scraps from the Hollywood table. I always feared he would sell out eventually. I just thought he would have commanded a higher price.'  I did as well.   In :  The Lindsay Lohan breast augmentation theory  got a, uhm,  boost  from that significant cultural artifact  urlLink The National Enquirer , which writes:  ' Lindsay Lohan  is busting out these days. And it's not just thanks to the 17-year-old's hit movie, Mean Girls. 'There is no question in my mind that she has had breast augmentation, and I think the results are very good,' Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Wallace Goodstein tells Star. 'It looks like she has saline implants, which have taken her from a size A or small B to a size C or small D. The bigger breasts look very natural, which is what surgeons aim for,' adds Goodstein, who does not treat Lohan. When contacted, Lindsay's rep  Leslie Sloane Zelnik  laughed it off, saying she's 17 and still growing. But Star got a second opinion anyway. 'What you see is what you've got,' says New York-based cosmetic surgeon Dr.  Geoffrey Tobias . 'It would seem to be obvious... that she did have breast augmentation.''

Hes got British Airways' 'Special Services' on speed dial (no ticket or passport lines, thank you very much), two sets of Vespas parked in London and Paris (the quickest way to make an airport connection), an impossibly chic wife ( French Vogues contributing editor  Masako Kumakura ) whipping up authentic Japanese meals for him at his enormous  Avenue Victor Hugo  apartment in Paris, and a supremely well-connected 'roommate' in London (art curator Alannah Weston, whose daddy owns  Selfridges  and  Fortnum Mason ).  Basically, Massimos on a non-stop, never-a-dull-moment ride that takes him from the well-appointed boardrooms of Milan fashion giants in the morning to power lunches mid-day to the hottest table at Londons  Cipriani  restaurant for dinner.'

"       Last night, I decided to forego an exciting Saturday evening out and stay in for the night.  All I can say is, it was lovely listening to a Long Island girl who teaches English in Queens' life story from my window and even lovelier to hear the frat boy slumming it in the East Village point out the large rat he saw at Cafe Gigi to the girl he was mostly likely going to pass out on top of mid-coitus later that night.  Whoohoo.  I woke up feeling as damaged and irritated as I would have if I had gone out, downed three pints, and discussed my boring life with a semi-stranger.   I really need to move somewhere grown-up -- especially now that East Village rents are so overpriced.  Anyhow, besides eavesdropping, I decided to start early on the Sunday Times and watch some news.  My first try was Fox.  (I just rented Outfoxed the other night and made a conscious decision to sit through some Murdoch hell).  Anyhow, that Geraldo sure is dumb.  His journalistic reporting seemed like some kind of Robocop/Starship Troopers/E! hybrid style and I proceeded to yell at him along with the idiot lawyer who is attempting to ban sex toys from America.  What's wrong with America????  What has happened to this lovely land that I love???   Oh yeah, and then I watched the Iraqi war reports and yelled at that too.  Give peace a chance???  Oh yeah, and then I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the Olsen twins are taking over/building a penthouse in a NYU dorm.  Um, since when is that okay?  Why don't they just get their own freakin' apartment.  And jeez, doesn't anyone recall that story about the NYU student who was so broke he had to live in the library?  How are people like that going to feel when they see the Olsen twins in their pad?  This is terrible.   Do people just not think anymore?  Anyhow, as I contemplated just this thought, I clicked to a different channel and rapidly began to grow scared and paranoid as the television screen blinked code orange at me and I was told to beware of cyber-stalking.   As I watched the attractively bland anchorwoman spout facts at me, I recalled my friendster profile and other such things and entered a restless sleep, haunted by death threats, war, and Denise, the teacher from Long Island's loud and nauseating voice.

"       So the title of this post is pretty much self explanatory.  I went to a Greek wedding last night and it was something out of the movies.  Yes, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  Good guess.  Anyway, they had the cake and all the other desserts and the polkas(which by the way are polish) AND they had the Greek dances where everyone dances around in a circle, or something.  I went outside when all that fun started.  Before all the dancing though, the best man gave about a ten minute speech, but it was well worth it.  The bar was only serving Bud and Bud light, amongst all the 'hard' liquor.  I saw some bottles of Miller Light and went on a mission to find where they were coming from.  Seems as though the wedding party had a cooler full of them from the Transpo Trolley(instead of renting a limo, they got the city transpo trolley to drive them around downtown south bend)  So being the good friend that I am of the bride, I got me some beer worth drinking for the rest of the night.  Good food, great company and an even better kisser made the night.     Sports Report  Looks like the wooden broom took a shit.

"                 recently, i had someone ask me if i always had turned to God (in terms of over time). well, the answer to that isn't as simple as it should be. i always knew about God. i was brought into the Lord's company as a small child. in retrospect (looking at my life over the years) i know that God had me then as He has me even now. i just didn't pursue Him like i should've. i am glad that i was asked that question. no i have not always turned to God, but He has always been right there anyway.  yesterday i ogt up early and felt pretty good about doing my Bible study in the morning as opposed to at night. the truth is i woke up because i had a bad dream. probobly the worst dream a man that loves a woman can dream, and after nearly squeezing the life out of wife after waking up (and waking her up which was not so good an idea), i sought refuge in the Word. i do the same now. i am feeling like i am slowly drifting back into the doomloop that has been my walk over the last four years. i want God and all of His love and affection, but i know that even if i do not feel that, i carry on in obedience. 'as i walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name'    are you so foolish? after beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort? - Galatians 3:3   chapter 3 of Galatians focuses on the church's attempts to receive the Spirit by obeying the law. it is only to believe. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law...   ...cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree. - Galatians 3:13   He even took on the curse of the law so that we could be blessed as Abraham was. Christ took all of this on because God wanted to be intimate with us. He missed us. He made the first move. He died a sinner's death after living a perfect life, so now we act on that blessing. HE MADE THE FIRST MOVE. grace is freedom from the law. We respect the law, and we obey it for the reason of having God glorified through our works, but our relationship with Him and our salvation comes from Christ and Christ alone. His wounds healed us. each lash of the whip was for our iniquity. that is love, i want to be intimate with that God, Jesus is King of the World and I submit to His perfect will.    This world has nothing for me, and this world has everything - Caedmon's Call                ",male

"             My wife and I work for The Salvation Army in southwestern New York State. Most people assume that means we work at a used clothing store or something. Actually, we pastor a small church (!) for the organization that seeks to be 'a church for people who don't like church.' We aren't really trying to be some hip, modern production, (one visit on a Sunday morning would disprove that theory) just a community of people who can be authentic with each other and God.  We took a trip on Sunday to visit  urlLink The Freeway , a newish Salvation Army church in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It's always beneficial to see how other people approach establishing a new church. Keep the good ideas and dump the rest and all that!  We really enjoyed ourselves. Authentic community and nice people. We'd recommend it to anyone in the Hamilton area. Our approach to 'doing church' is very similar, and we found ourselves comforted by that fact. It's hard doing something new in the church, and it seems like no matter how sincere your intentions or how good your results, that there are always people ready to 'throw a stone' that you aren't doing it the old-fashioned way. It's natural to second-guess yourself sometimes, and my wife and I had been doing a lot of that lately. As my wife joked on our drive out of Hamilton, 'It's nice to know we aren't the only crazy ones...' It was good to meet some people who knew the joys and struggles of establishing a nontraditional church plant.         ",male
"             I don't know why I keep telling people this, because I'm certainly not proud of it... but I saw the movie 'Soul Plane.'  Yeah, I know... I know.  It was a dumb thing to do, but the circumstances under which I saw the film made sense at the time (although they are certainly no excuse).  I had a bevy of free tickets for the Destinta theater out in Bridgeville, and they expired last week, so I had to go and use them up... I mainly saw movies that I had already seen, like 'The Punisher' and 'Shrek 2' and then, in a move that I can only attribute to a moment of weakness, poor timing, peer pressure, and desperation, I saw 'Soul Plane.'  So far, I've gotten the same reaction from everyone I've admitted this to: 'Oh God, what were you thinking?!'  And the answer is 'I have no clue.'  The whole movie looked more like a train wreck from a mile away.  Have you seen the trailer?  It looked absolutely terrible... and I assure you, if you make the same mistake I did and actually take the time to watch the movie, your guess about the movie will be proven.  It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  And while I could sit here and critique this movie like I would any film, wasting time on the technical flaws of the movie would be pointless.  Just thinking about the content of this film would make anyone, of any race, just shake their heads.  In what had the potential to be the 'soulful' version of the comedy classic 'Airplane!', 'Soul Plane' is nothing more than a 90 minute MTV-stereotyped, racially-charged, mess of a film that makes me wish I had the comforting arm of TV's George Lopez to cry on... that's pretty bad.  Let me start by talking about what goes on in the movie.  There is this giant purple plane with hydraulics (which is probably one of the few cool aspects of the movie) and it's flying with a bunch of stereotypes... and Tom Arnold.  I don't understand how any race could NOT be offended by this movie.  There is one Arab on the plane, and of course there are a few 9-11 jokes to go along with him.  There are four white people on the plane, they have the last name of 'Honkey' and they are coming home from a vacation to 'Crackerland.'  Come on now... and then of course the plane is filled with African Americans.  And for once I agree with Spike Lee and his joints-a-plenty.  This movie is most offensive towards blacks!  Sure there were a few times throughout the movie that I chuckled at what was going on on screen.  Perhaps it is just the overall faux pas nature of this racist piece of cinema (the lower class section of the plane gets a piece of Popeye's fried chicken for their in-flight meal), afterwards I felt a little weird about the whole movie.  What kind of audience are they making this for?    Well I can tell you.  It was made for the pop-culture-loving teens of this day and age.  And they are eating it up.  There is a reason why this awful movie is number 5 across the nation.  It's the same reason that they are making a movie called 'Harold and Kumar go to White Castle' and a movie called 'The Cook Out.'  Because America loves dumb shit.  America loves stereotypes and humor that, when attached using electrodes to a bowl of green Jello, barely causes ripples.  Now I saw this movie because I had a free ticket, and so technically they didn't make any money off of me and my buddies.  But someone out there is seeing this movie, and it's not good for America or Hollywood (who is going to do nothing but continue to make this kind of crap).    So if anyone asks... I saw Soul Plane to further my knowledge of cultural studies.  And because I had a free ticket.          ",female

"             I haven't blogged in over a month ... sounds like a confession, doesn't it? I wanted to, but don't always get time when I want to say something. Kent hogs the computer when he's home, so if I want to blog, I have to do it when he's at work or late at night.  Good things have happened: Cayla turned 8 and got baptized Saturday. Bad things have happened: Kent ran the cell phone bill up - $345 and a check Mom wrote me for a loan bounced so that I have to pay the $20 overcharge fee plus  $5 per day  and I don't know how many days her bank is charging for. It looks like my check tomorrow will go for bills and bank charges, and forget about Christmas presents for the girls. I was going to spend $50 on each girl for Christmas... they will have to wait until Kent gets paid next week.  That's another issue. Besides the whole - he doesn't like my input on  his  money thing - his company started mailing the paychecks instead of overnighting them to the job site. So, instead of getting his check on Wednesday every two weeks, they've been coming on Friday. The first payday had Veterans Day in it, the second had Thanksgiving Day. The last one didn't have a holiday, but it's the busiest mailing season of the year. Next week has Christmas... I just hope his check arrives on Friday and not Saturday.  It's going to be difficult to explain to the girls (ages 8 and 10) that they won't get Christmas presents on Christmas, they will have to wait until Daddy gets his check. Thanks, Securitas office in Des Moines... for making my Christmas just a little bit brighter.

"       If you wake up in the morning and wonder why are there rice dumplings hanging all over...its Tuen Ng festival today!   Now, why the heck rice dumplings you might ask? Well,the festival commemorates the death of a national hero, Qu Yuan, who drowned himself as a protest against the corrupt rulers of the 3rd century China. Legend has it that the villagers threw rice dumplings into the river and beat drums to scare the fish away from his body in an attempt to rescue him. This is only one of the legend's variation,there are various out there.  The rice dumplings usually contain mushrooms,sliced pork,beans,glutinious rice and a duck egg yolk.Wrapped around tightly in bamboo leaves, these are boiled and then voila its ready for consumption  For those of you that know me, you just KNOW that the next part of Tuen Ng is comming up...the Dragon Boat races.YEpps!  As a very *aherm* knowledgeable person in the arena of Dragon Boating (yeah right!!) my fav site for Dragon Boat races is  urlLink here .  Stanley is a huge, HUGE international dragon boat competition.With over 146 teams this year,most are half drunk even before they touch the water.All in good fun me lass,all in good fun.Apparently the more 'serious' and competitive teams do not compete in Stanley..it's a second class competition.There's one up at  urlLink Macau  too...and thats the more 'professional' one.  Dragon boating season starts from April till July..when I say season,I meant the competitions held that I know about.Obviously winter is off season, but i know one of the better  urlLink teams  who are really good starts practice in January.The purple peeps paddle at competitions all around the world...from Guam to South Africa to Penang and Hawaii. Amazing.They'll be over at Macau for Tuen Ng.  Started off as a national pastime in Stanley during the late 60s,by the 70s the expats have already jumped the boat,so to speak, and joined in the good fun.Due to the tinier sized chinese..(OK not trying to be insulting here  but due to  my good mood,Im laughing my aris off on the implications of that line), the expats are eventually shooo-ed off to create their own category..

"       Misery Loves Company  And what good company I'm in!  Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who responded to my last blog entry, both here and in private.  I heard from people I didn't even know were reading, people who have been there and done that, people who used to be here and used to do this and have moved on to other rewarding endeavors.    In giving it some thought over the last couple of days, it's clear my discontent is two-fold.  Obviously, as many of you have commented, the vocal members of the gaming fan base can be persnickety and critical.  It's not just limited to the fans, either; at the worst of times my fellow industry professionals have been known to be critical and petty and vicious concerning the work of others.  However, even without that element, even if I removed myself from or never was confronted with the petty criticisms that run rampant all around me, there's a more nagging feeling that I'm just not doing anything  important  or lasting or meaningful.  That there are more important things that need to be done in the world, and I'm shirking.  I felt this way for a while after my daughter was born and people started treating me like an adult and a mother.  I couldn't get over the feeling that I was going to be found out: I'm no mother, when did I become a grown-up?  That I was only faking it, didn't know what I was doing or wasn't doing it 'right' and sooner or later I was going to be found out, exposed.  That feeling has faded as I've 'faked it' as a mother for long enough and both my daughter and I seem to have come through ok.  'Fake it 'til you make it,' as a friend says to me.  I guess where mothering is concerned, I've made it.  But this career of making games, even after 15 years and especially in the face of the greater needs facing my immediate community, my extended family, my citizens of my country, the rest of the people in the world...I again feel like a charlatan, a fraud.  Getting by doing what I'm doing only because no one is examining very closely what it is I'm up to; as if some authority figure is going to burst into the room at any moment, yelling, 'Didn't I tell you to put those things away?  Now, get out there and mow the lawn, and save some endangered species while you're at it, you slacker!'  I suppose I just don't want to be accused of fiddling (in the  engaging in nonsensical, trifling matters  sense, not in the  to play the violin  sense) while the world burns.  Meanwhile, I spend the day preparing for WedCon.  The guest list is in flux, what with people having car crashes, hurricanes closing down airports, and generally flaky and forgetful friends being flaky and forgetful.  Still, I expect to see some 40-50 people on Saturday, and I intend to feed them all.

"               'The US Supreme Court in a 5-4 ruling said that a lower court was right to block the 1998 law because it might prevent adults from accessing legal pornographic material. The law (COPA) would jail and heavily fine online smut merchants who don't require adult-access codes, personal identification or credit cards to access their Web sites.'  Now, I don't visit porn sites, nor do I want our children to, but the way the 1998 COPA law is written, it'll also affect sites giving info on medical advise about breast, testicle cancer and on adult sexuality info because of the 'adult' content. These sites could face jail time & fines just as well as the porn sites.  'the court's ruling 'demonstrates that there are many less restrictive ways to protect children without sacrificing communication intended for adults. ... The court has made it safe for artists, sex educators and Web publishers to communicate with adults about sexuality without risking jail time.''  You see, I feel no one has the right to trample on my 1st constutional right... especially when there is a much simplier way to make sure your children are safe. It's called, parental supervision. That's right, spend some time with your children and surf with them. Then you'll know where they are going and what they are seeing, online. Don't expect the US government to babysit your children and take over your responsibilities as a caring, loving parent at the expense of my constitutional right to free speech and expression. Get the needed software/programs to block what you don't want your child to see and then spend some quailty time surfing with him/her. And leave my 1st constutional right alone. ********************** It is a wise father that knows his own child.

"             SUNDAY night: we went to see Win a Date with Tad Hamilton.. it was cute... predictable.. but cute.  As our movie ended and we went to wait for Danielle's mom, Courtney ran into her friend Dylan.. who happens to be quite hot!  Things got really awkward after a couple minutes of talking.. so me and Danielle left Courtney standing there.  Then we all went outside into the cold night air.  Decided we wanted to see the hottness again and went inside where it was warm. We were sitting at the table with them and I looked at Dylan and if I were asking him to pass the napkins I asked him if we could see under his clothes! The best part was HE SHOWED US! Nice nipple ring he has! I wanted to touch it! hee hee  MONDAY: well I got up EARLY to write my biology provincial.  I think I did alright on it.  We went to Tim Hortons with Jenn and her sister and made fun of Josh for like 20 minutes! It was sooo funny! I don't think I have laughed that hard since me and Courtney laughed about our porn videos were 'are' gonna make! hahaha Then my aunt and I went to look for prom dresses.... I FOUND IT!!!!

"   Technical Aspects My Support System  Mainly my support system consists of Mark, Candy and Sieg! These are my friends with technical expertise and I regularly cry on their shoulders when I don’t understand the cryptic secrets of my computer.  As two of them will soon be heading off into the wild blue yonder overseas I have to pick as many brains as possible before this happens.  What will I do if my computer crashes?  I’ve had painful experience of this happening – twice! – since I started this course.  My recourse is the school network.  I spend long, lonely hours in the school computer laboratory on Saturdays and Sundays, but the work gets done!  Broad Specs of my Computer  Computer:   Intel Celeron CPU 1.70GHz AT/AT Compatible 97, 776 KB RAM   Operating System:MicroSoft Windows 2000 5.00.2195 Service Pack 2   Internet Connectivity  Speed:On average 44 Kb/s Modem connection: Softk56 Data Fax Voice Speakerphone CARP ISP:  Mweb    Applications I use ApplicationDetailsExpertise Word Processor MicroSoft Word 2000 and XP 4-5 Web browser Internet explorer 6.03-4 HTML editor Basic?0 Sound equipment:  speakers, sound card, able to generate .wav filesSpeakers and Sound Card; MPU-401 Compatible Midi Device0 Graphics create/editing program Macromedia Flash 3?0  Cognitive Aspects  Previous Experience with Distance Learning  None except what I’ve experienced from the beginning of this year.  I had perforce to be a distance student because I’m situated in Port Elizabeth and can only get to Tukkies three times a year.  So I’ve had enforced distance education, but haven’t really been part of a virtual learning community before.  Current Level of Dexterity using WWW  I feel fairly comfortable.  I use www.metacrawler.com a LOT because I find it suits my style of browsing.  I’ve often been disappointed with other search engines but seldom with metacrawler.  How accessible is the web for me in terms of finances?  That’s a tricky one!  Naturally I’d love to use the facilities at work (we have 24 hour a day access at school) but I prefer to work from the comfort of my own home.  With the help of the Tukkies bursary and a study loan I should be able to keep myself connected for the duration of the course!    My Typing Speed You really know how to put people on the spot!  I took Typing as a matric subject so I’m fairly comfortable with it.  It was the most sensible subject choice I made.  I typed fairly quickly at school and have still retained some of my old skill. (I typed this at 22:20 when I was very tired so I feel quite proud of my achievement!)      My Expectations of the Course  Every course in M.Ed. (CIE) has challenged me so far.  At times I resent the fact that I have to learn so many new things in so short a space of time, but in retrospect I must acknowledge that if the deadlines hadn’t been there, I would probably never have learned to use certain programs.  I expect to learn a lot more about chatting – I’ve only done this once or twice before and must confess that I’m not a natural-born web-chatter.  Perhaps I prefer to see people’s expressions so that I can react to them.  With a structured chat environment and focused topics, I expect to develop a greater level of comfort in this area.  I certainly expect to learn as much as I did with both the previous modules.  I’ve already learned to chat, and how to use a whiteboard!  I’m slowly learning about the basic components of my computer e.g. the sound cards etc.  I’m very excited about being forced to learn how to publish a blog and the various things that go along with that.  Whether I’ll be successful remains to be seen ……         ",female

"   Quick note about Beltran before I get back to studying for my test in an hour.    Kent and Hidalgo are scheduled to make $20.5 million combined this year.  Their options for 2005 are $9 million and $15 million, respectively.  My point...McLane just needs to bone up and spend some more money this next offseason.    So here's my ideal offseason.  You sign Berkman and Oswalt to 4 year deals...maybe backload them just a little bit...you know, for when Bagwell's contract is finally off the books.  You could probably get each for $10 million/year each.  Berkman's already making $6.5 million this year, so that jump don't represent a lot more.  Oswalt's not making shit this year, so that would be a big jump.  But say that's like $13 million / year increase for the two combined.  Who's to say they can't be had for a little cheaper??  Then you just pony up and sign Beltran.  I don't care how...JUST DO IT!  Otherwise, our offense is gonna suck in a few years.  If you pay Beltran $15 million / year, then you've increased payroll about $28 million for these 3 players.  But you got then after dropping over $20 million in payroll in Kent and Hidalgo (who's options for the year would've cost $24 million).  So who would you rather have:  Kent and Hidalgo for one more year at $24 million, or Oswalt, Berkman, and Beltran locked up to long-term deals for an increase of $28 million to payroll.  One more thing I forgot...I believe we only signed Clemens for a year.  If I'm correct, that's another $5 million we no longer have on the books next year.  My final point:  the money's going to be there if McLane will just be willing to spend it.  And I can't remember the last really good, YOUNG player that we've signed...I think we're due.  That is all. ",male
"           It was an astounding discussion today! I'm surprised at our third period class today, we actually did some genuine discussions! Without more than five minutes of silent stares at each other! That's a huge benchmark for us. LOL.   Ok Nova, we may have a different stance on this issue about the discussion of 'racism'. I think the controversy of it is really really interesting, and really relevant to the society we live in today. Maybe whining about it doesn't help, and only makes the matter worse. But one has to study the history behind racism, the history behind slavery, and study the current society in general to get all these controversies and see that these debates are very interesting. If we are living in a place like Chicago, Los Angeles, NYC, San Francisco, or Atlanta, we might see the issue and controversies surrounding the issues of race and racism in a very different way, because the societies of these urban centers are so polygot that you CANNOT ignore the issue of race at all. And it becomes so relevant to your everyday lives, whether you like it or not. So I don't think we can make a judgement on how the issue of 'racism' is sooooo out of date and dumb now. To a lot of people, it's very relevant to their lives. And reading this book Huck Finn I'm sure will help us understand better the deep history behind slavery, race relationships between whites and blacks, that still influences our thinkings today. And I agree with today's discussion just banning the N word will not solve any any racial problem at all, not even down to the scale of molecules. There are a lot of other forms of racial discriminatory actions that we can not ban because of free speech issue such as Erin's description of all the confederate flags in the south still. And for christ's sake it's a piece of literature, one of the best pieces of American lit every written. And to the issue of calling people 'whites', 'blacks', 'African Americans' whatever, I agree with the discussions today that it's a matter of respect. Some people maybe offended by calling 'black', others maybe 'African Americans', so it. But I agree that in general, we just have to see all people as one group of Americans, and not place any body into a race or cultural profile. --------- So, what do you think of that?

"       Hello all, I hope everyone is doing wonderful!  I'm so happy that my love is recovering so well and that he is surrounded by encouraging and loving friends! My heart fell on the floor Wednesday evening when Todd called to tell me about his amazing collapsible lung...I've never felt so helpless. Thankfully he reassured me of his condition, it was as if he had already anticipated my questioning prior to his call, he remained calm and collected, telling me the details. I'm so proud of him for seeking care, I only wished I could have been there. He's super hero Todd...of course he'd do fine...I on the other hand tried not to sound anxious while simultaneously flipping through numerous medical books on treatment & prognosis. I couldn't help thinking...will this serve as a turning point and give him the purpose to quit smoking? All the while as important a factor smoking is, my concern was to address the immediate dangers, and so I made sure he wasn't having any shortness of breathing or difficulty breathing. I wanted to give him warning signs but not be alarming, yet I was sure he got all this at the ER...what else could I do. Timing is a delicate thing...the last thing he needed was me (of all people-given my history) saying something like, ya know you really outta quit smoking. I know he knows, it was apparent in the sighs...and pauses over the phone. All night I tossed and turned, the next day stricken with nausea, I saw patients which gratefully kept me focused on all things not Todd. I was elated to hear that he will be OK! I was sad to hear that this could happen again...something I already expected from my readings but remained hopeful for better news. I know the surgical procedure is an option but an expensive one, medical insurance would be a necessity. Soon, soon I say...Todd will have the best healthcare insurance as long as I can help it! I was secretly hoping that Todd would say, oh yeah, the doc's advise that I quit as well. After inquiring, the surgeon let that one slip by. I quickly said, it's documented that you decrease you're odds of this happening again by at least 50% if you quit now. He'd already had it covered, his arm that is with the nicoderm patch, ahhh I sigh in relief, I am so proud of him! Again, I just want to send my appreciation to all of you for supporting him...he has the best friends ever!  As for me, I'm already well into my family medicine rotation, in Beaverton, OR. I am absolutely loving every moment! I was extremely nervous the first week, trying to resist being thrown into seeing complicated patients on my own. I am learning at an amazing speed, time flies at clinic, I come home enter patients and procedures in the computer each night...look up everything I had seen that day, do write-ups and read some more...sleep a little and wake up and repeat. Each patient uniquely different accompained with new challenges...never a dull moment even for the simple ear ache or muscle strain. Already, I've done numerous PAPs, well child exams, male exams, and regularly see diabetes, HTN, asthma, thyroid disorders, mental disorders...it goes on & on, the crazy thing is the more you learn the more you realize what you don't know and thus you strive to learn more. Yesterday I had a 15 hr + day, working at the clinic during the day and the free clinic at night. Each Thursday, in Hillsboro, doctors, nurses, lab techs, interpreters & students come to volunteer free healthcare. It is the most rewarding experience. It's difficult to see the masses of people in need but their appreciation is priceless. Next, I am scheduled for Houston, TX in cardiology I can't wait especially since I'll be closer to my love! I'll try to post more often and share some experiences if you gals are interested.   One last thing, I just got done reading this incredible book called, Complications, a surgeon's notes on an imperfect science by Atul Gawande. I highly recommend it! He is a surgical resident in the Boston area, graduated from Harvard, and is a staff writer on medicine and science for The New Yorker, national book award finalist, national best-seller, need I go on. This is by far one of my favorites! Take care, Diana                  ",female

"                 Its officialy the end of thursday (in my books at least) and its prety much the same as it always was, and always will be. It was hot, and not much happened, but I'll tell ya what I remember happening.  Second period I had a assembly thing, I tryed to read the whole time but they were just talking to much and to load so I couldn't remember if I was reading or listening, so I put my book away. They weren't talking about much either, at least nothing I haven't already heard. I also got the full scoop on that afterschool design class, It was one of them ROP classes so by law they wouldn't let freshmen in. It was still quite rude of him to give me the boot with out answering any questions.  Third period I found out I have a math test tomorrow, but it being reviews and stuff I learned in 5th grade math (I was quite advanced for my age, not to sound to boastful) so I'm sure to ace it.  Fourth period I have to memorize the second stanza of the poem I posted earlyer. I can't even remember the first. I'm gonna have to repeat it to myself again. It's not gonna be easy when I have to recite the WHOLE poem from memory.  Fifth period was hot again, so we all went into the gym to play some basketball. I actualy tryed to participate this time. I think I finaly memorized my locker combo too. I think.  Sixth period I found out we have a test tomorrow. (hence the 'german test friday' in the title) I'm getting fairly good, german is a simple, and cool language to learn. I'm gonna ace this test too.  After school my front tire was flat again, It's annoying because I have to walk it in the opposite direction of where I'm supposed to be heading just to pump it back up at the 7/11, and then I have to ride all the way back to the school and go on from there. I realy hate these thorns that lie around just WAITING for a bike to run it over so that it can put a tiny hole in it and slowly deflate it. Even the slime wont protect you, you have to get those realy expensive heavy duty tires made of solid ruber, and I only have it on the back tire.

"           Maybe I'm strange, but right this minute, I'm sitting here crying. For no real reason at all. Just crying. Yeah, it's been a bad day, but we all have them, and I'm not one to just sit around and cry about it. The reality seems to have set in that in about two weeks, I will be without a job. Scary feeling. Christmas is coming up and that stresses the hell out of me.  I've decided I'm not a terribly nice person. More like mean. I screamed at a kid this morning because she wasn't doing what I told her and made her cry. She's one of the toughest athletes on our team, and I made her cry. I would classify her as a tougher athlete than I am, and never once did a coach make me cry. So, what do I do as a follow up to this screaming display? I pick a fight with Jake. It's near impossible to fight with him, but I found a way and he's not talking to me right now. I don't blame him, I wouldn't talk to me either. I also managed to make my headhunter cry today as well, although I really don't think that had anything to do with me. She was crying the first time I met her. I think it's her thing. So, it seems that crying is the theme for the day.  One fun thing happened today. We had a fundraiser 3-on-3 basketball tournament between the coaches of all the sports on campus. Nothing feels better than schooling basketball coaches at basketball. They always discount the track coaches as little waifish people who don't know how to do anything but run. Well, this year, they had a little secret weapon. A 6'2' former all-stater in everything, former volleyball wizard, and former sprinter and now long distance maniac. Myself, Jake and Buck just dominated the hell out of that tournament. When I play anything pissed off, it doesn't bode well for the opposing team. At one point, the men's basketball coach asked the women's basketball coach why I wasn't recruited to play basketball instead of volleyball. He informed him that I was, but that I couldn't swing 3 sports and still remain sort of sane. After a monster block, the men's coach turned to the women's coach again and said that he wasn't sure I was sane to begin with. Gotta love coaches. We're odd. In a good way. Sometimes.  All in all, I need a job. And I need it fast. I hate office jobs. With a passion. That's my only option.         ",female

"       April 15, 2004  Eug was heckling me tonight. You see, I needed to run to the grocery store for braunschweiger and milk - and according to Eug, this was a combination of things that was both gross and laugh-out-loud funny. (For what it's worth, I needed the freakin' braunschweiger because my buddy Amy had a brilliant suggestion to feed little pieces of wheat bread smeared with 'da braun' now that Xanthe is fierce about only feeding herself, thankyouverymuch. Besides, I couldn't very well keep feeding the child Cheerios and canned green beans forever, now could I?) Anyhoo, this devolved into a conversation about the kinds of things, in combination, that would surely result in raised eyebrows at the grocery store. Such as: braunschweiger, beer, and Glamour magazine. Cow's feet and douche. Pickles and toothpicks. Etc. Feel free to e-mail me with your suggestions for gross combinations. If I get any good ones, I'll share them.  The other thing I am still laughing about is a little snippet from The Simpsons. It's the episode where Homer and Marge go out drinking and Homer crashes the car. In an effort to avoid losing his license, he plants an unconscious Marge behind the wheel to make it look like *she's* the boozer. When everyone in town thinks Marge is a drunk after she goes to jail for drunk driving, there's this scene where the Simpsons are at church in line for communion, and as Marge takes the wine, old Mrs. Skinner says something like 'Hey! Leave some for the rest of us, alkie!' But the thing that keeps making me howl is what comes next - Otto, the stoner bus driver is behind Mrs. Skinner and says (in inimitable Otto fashion)   'Yeah! Don't Bogart our Lord!'   It may or may not surprise you to know that I do a dead-on Otto impression, and I can't keep myself from repeating this line ad nauseum. Even Henry is getting in on the act!  I'm still struggling mightily with my weight. I was doing so well - lost 15 pounds in the six weeks from January to mid-February. Had muscle tone, energy, pride, you name it. Then I got the stomach flu and it wiped me out for a few days - followed by a bad cold, and then another, etc. What a mess. Now I cannot seem to find the strength to pick up the pieces and move forward. Ugh. Eating junk, not drinking water, yadda yadda yadda. In fact, hang on - let me go grab a water.  That's better. Now, let me ask you this - what's up with you people who don't read? Seriously, what do you  do , anyway? I mean, I watch TV. I lounge around. I play video games. What I'm getting at here is that I know how to waste time with the best of them. Plus, I have two children in diapers, OK? And I still read as much as I can because I think I would  die  if I didn't have something that I'm currently reading - no matter how long it takes me to finish a book these days. Eug surprised me with a couple of things from my Amazon wishlist today: a creepy little vintage children's book still in print for some strange reason, and John McWhorter's book about the degradation of the English language in speech, print and music. I am drooling just thinking about getting into that one. Isn't reading like something your body cannot live without? You non-readers. I just don't get you. A house is not a home without staggering stacks of beloved books hither and yon, damn it. And like I've said before, reading People magazine does NOT count.   All right, that's it for tonight.

"                 Ok, so I'm Rrr as you could maybe possibly tell from the title and web site. If not . . . well. . . then I'm telling you now . . . I'm Rrr. The one and only Rrr there is. No, you cannot steal my name. It's mine. All mine! Yeah so . . . I’m kinda not too much very old, and yes I know I’m using lots of extra unneed words, even words that aren’t words . . . this is my blog I’ll do what I want with it. So bleah! . *sticks out tongue* Anyway not too old, teen. And I’m kinda very secretive so don’t be so surprised. Well I am female human . . . actually not all human. (Technically, yes I am but I pretend I’m not so get used to it or don’t read my blog buddy) :-). Yeah so, I’m part cat . . . ever seen the anime character Inuyasha? Well if not . . . look it up because I don’t want to explain. You can probably find a picture somewhere of him, that’s all you really need. And then make him, female, kitty ears . . . they look pretty much the same as his, still has the fangs and claws, tail, (#, forget this for now, it will come later) change the outfit. . . I don’t care what . . . actually yes I do . . . nothing perverted or anything . . . decent clothes. Sheesh, ok sorry, back to changing Inuyasha to me . . . Lavender . . . another name for me . . .don’t ask . . . anyway . . . where was I? Oy . . . ok, before I go back to what I was saying . . . oy-it’s my word I made it up . . . no it’s not the religious kinda oy or French oui or whatever . . . it’s oy. Something I say when there’s either nothing else to say, I’m exasperated, I’m frustrated, I’m confused but saying oy because it will get me out of having to know what you’re talking about, when I’m rolling my eyes oy usually follows, um . . . that’s some of the meaning of oy. Ok,now that you're totally confused, back to what I was saying, about Inuyasha into a cat called Lavender. (Go to the # sign since I use * signs to show an action of some sort . . . yes that’s is what it means) ok so still has fangs, claws, add a tail, which won’t be stepped on by anybody who wants to live, and I think that's about it . . . oh . . . eyes . . . green cat eyes too. That’s why I will be making references to kitty actions, that is my new thing. And the color of my fur/hair-creamy white, with pink tufts on the ears and end of tail. Ok, well, other information. By the way I know this would drive an English teacher crazy or anyone else who loves order for that matter, but it’s very hard to just describe me without adding things in describing the things that describe me. :-), got that? Maybe I could have those things in books where you put a number by a certain thing then go to it at the bottom of the page and look it up. I’ll try to do that from now on, because I’m too lazy to go back and fix it, and I would just to delete all this because it wouldn’t apply anymore. Ok, sorry again back to other information now . . . back to your previously scheduled program . . . tehehehe. I like D&D . . . dungeons and dragons . . . I play video games. Hang out with the church youthies and Shane. (1)(that means go to the bottom of the page or wherever there’s a number one, ;-)...) Play Sims, wee, Makin’ Magic and Pets, and a Deluxe version, and of course the original. Boyfriend: none, never had one, won’t have one until I find someone who I like and they like me back . . . might be a while. Likewise never been kissed . . . don’t get any ideas (bares fangs and claws, hissing menacingly) Job: bleah, none . . . don’t want one, sigh, being told constantly to get one by parents . . .refuse . . . for a while, until I want some money. Drive: not quite, do have my temps . . . don’t use them too often, but I have them. Sheltered: Completely. Oy. Very, very, very sheltered. School: Junior this August, well now, but when school starts I will be in 11th grade.Weeee, upper classmen/woman, oh joy. Ok, so let’s see is that it? Hmmm, well that’s it for now. Hope you didn’t get too lost on your tour of the infamous Rrrrrrrrrrrrr.  1) the youthies are the youth group members at my church, which mostly just consist of Shawn,Greg, and Paul . . . or collectively the Stouts, no there not dwarfs or anything it’s just a nickname. (Oh, me too, I'm a youthy as well) Well I listed them from oldest to youngest, one just out of high school, one’s last year and one just starting I think. And I don’t like any of them as boyfriends or anything, so forget it. Oh and Shane is the youth leader, in his 20's, he’s cool, annoying, they gang up on me and pick on me, but I pick on them right back so it’s ok. Shane is also currently the boyfriend of my Sister, Sarah, and works for my dad, he has a plastering company. Plus my dad’s also recently the pastor of our church which we (my family . . . mom, dad, Sarah, and me . . . I . . . whatever) came to um, let’s see *mentally counts* about seven years ago, maybe. And he’s been pastor two years in August. Yeah, so I’m not really too much of a PK(pastors’ kid)      ",female
"       I'm not much for free verse poetry.  I think it's more of an expression for yourself than for others.  For me it is anyway, its how I vent. Not surprisingly, the only real poems I've written in the last two years or so, class assignments excluded, have been about Laura.  There's one in my other blog.  My problem is, whenever I write a poem I actually like, it's to personal for me to share with anyone.  I find I can't write poetry about something unless I really, deeply, care about it, in which case I can't share it. Getting back to the point, I really can't judge because I just can't get into that form of poetry.  I don't know enough about what makes it 'good' -- seems pretty arbitrary to me.  My question is, do you perform it, or are you being judged purely on the writing? Lara - don't you think Tiny Explosions fits Sophia's title scheme better? Marten - It's Larry.

"           Hello whoever you are reading this! I hope you are well, and won't be too bored, and to be honest, tough poo if you are because no one's making you read this! I really haven't got a clue what I'm going to say at the moment as this is my first post, so please bear with me!  First of all, I'll tell you a little about myself. I have been with my boyfriend, Dan, for three years, and I live in Bristol in the UK. I love reading (almost anything), I love films (except the odd dire film like 'The Mexican', which in my humble opinion was as interesting as eating cardboard), I love photography, and at this moment in my life I also love my job - an admin role. My hates include freestyle jazz, which is frankly as appealing as having glass stabbed in my eyes, Jim Davidson (don't get me started on that one), people who constantly ask a/s/l on chatrooms, and smelly people on the bus.  OK, so what next? Well I would like to state for the record that Gareth Gates is crap. I'm sorry, I just can't hold it in any more. He can't sing, and he looks like a gerbil. And what's with that hair? It also annoys me that someone with no talent and so much younger than me is so much richer than me! Bastard! I can't sing either, but I don't see anyone giving me a record deal!! Damn it!  Random things that make me laugh are: 1) the word 'parp' 2) the phrase 'floury baps' 3) the phrase 'smell my cheese' (as per Alan Partridge) 4) A picture of Bernard Manning I once saw in Loaded,(I forget the caption but I was in hysterics for about ten minutes) 5) Gimme Gimme Gimme 6) Family Guy 7) Big pants 8) the word 'eggy' 9) Peter Kay  Random things that make me want to punch someone are: 1) Shopping - especially shoe shopping 2) Party Political Broadcasts 3) People who say 'I'm mad, me!' - you're not, you're a sad git 4) People who delight in being thick (Jade Goody as one example) 5) Pointless audio commentaries on films - I DON'T CARE WHY THE SCENE WAS LIT THAT WAY! LET ME WATCH THE FILM! 6) People who talk in the cinema 7) Children when they show off 8) People who don't say 'please' and 'thank you' 9) Shit bosses - grrrrrrrrrr!  One thing I always hated when I was single was patronizing people looking at me with sympathy saying 'Don't worry, I'm sure that he's out there for you.' Just because they were shacked up with a dickhead as soon as puberty hit, that doesn't mean I didn't want some fun first!  That's it for now. Nice to 'meet' you!

"       Before today's exam update, I hafta get one thing out of the way. Former blog member John Spence confronted me today on the fact that the blog has 'gone downhill' since he left, and yes his absence contributed to that, but the main thing (from him, not me) is that its become a 'pissing contest' between cooper and me talking about the biggest tools in pop music, so that ends here. Anyways...   UCC Exam Marathon Update #2    Math Studies - Normally a studies exam wouldn't be so ominous and looming for me, but I hadn't really paid much attention this term and some bad test results led me to think this would be a very difficult exam.... boy was I wrong. Wow, was it just me? or was that a really easy exam? No, it was an easy exam. First of all, the questions were all easy and straightforward, they all told you what to do, and most of them how to do it (that formula booklet is like cheating... only it's not!) Basically if you could operate a TI-83 (or any of the TI family of calculators) and had a pulse, you pass this exam. Although once again, i may have completely misjudged this one... but if I did I am one stupid dipshit because that exam was freakin easy.  Chillness Factor:  7 klons out of 5    Next time on Exam Update...  Yeah, I am really shitting my pants over Systems, I can't believe I put it 4 on my pre exam list of hardness... it is gonna be really hard. I want to study but something tells me I'm gonna be designing the new FOL Gear (it's happening soon, get your credit cards ready). But yeah, Systems will be tough. All that environmental and systems... aaaah! I'm gonna be studying, unlike Matt 'I never miss theatre, even when The View is on!'

"                 Ideas are starting for my next column.  Here's what I've got so far --  Before coming here, people kept telling me that law school was like high school  with lockers, required subjects, and classes with the same set of people.  But after Field Day last weekend, I think high school may have been pushing it.  Law school is really fifth grade.  My school had a Field Day in fifth grade.  It was pretty much like this one.  Except for the eight kegs.  And the section subciting competition.  (Kidding.)  But I think that may have been the last time I played dodgeball.  And I havent gotten any better at it than I was then.  In fifth grade, I remember there was an obsession with being one of the cool kids.  I'm not sure what being 'cool' meant in fifth grade -- I think it was still to young to be dating or anything like that, so that wasn't it.  I guess it was all about not getting beat up during recess, or getting invited to the boy-girl parties.  Or having someone to sit next to on the bus during field trips.  Or at the lunch table.  But I do remember that I wasn't one of the cool kids.  I'd be willing to bet that most people here weren't.  We were the smart kids.  The cool kids then are the ones working at the gas station now.

It was a real pig. A 250lb. pot-bellied pig. None of the animals other than the cat were very housebroken.  Anyway, she told the potential new realtors that I would meet them at the house to let them in to look at it before they list it. And yes, I mutely agreed to this. Is she paying me. Not really.

I got there today (after borrowing one of their $45,000 Rendezvous' - not a particularly nice vehicle, no matter what Tiger Woods says) and the service manager Felicio (felatio? service manager? the guy really did suck) tried to tell me that it wasn't covered. So I quickly beckoned to Gail '80's Hair' and she reinforced the situation regarding my mirror. I understand that Felatio was just doing his job, but seriously guy, don't fuck with me. I've been on both sides of the customer service equation and I'll assure you, I never fucking lose.  Quiz Night is just a blast. I enjoy it immensly. The topic this evening was rather engaging.         ",male
"       You know, the dictionary actually is quite interesting to read.  You find out alot of stuff that you didn't know before.  like, for example, you might be sitting one day wondering, there's a definition for everything, but what's the definition for 'definition'??  Well, it's simple, you just find it in the dictionary, and Voila!.... 'to state the specific meaning'. So there.  ya learn something knew everyday.  Anywho, So today I was sitting at my computer and Ashleigh came online, so I was like, sweet!  and i said hi to her.  Then, all of the sudden her name changes to 'jo is soooo cool!' and her picture changes to a thing that says 'Jo Rocks'  well, I as like, ok, whatever, she's just a little bit hyper and she must be talking to jo on the phone.  So then she starts saying all these wierd things like: 'you dumb hobo...' and 'indeed' and i was like, ok this is not something ashleigh would say, but whatever, she's turned wierd over nite.  Anyway, as you've probably already guessed, it was jocelyn... argh.  and i was obviously not all there becasue the hints were pretty huge.  So anyway, the moral of this story is to not be l'idiote like moi. :P  Hooray for us on our drama final! :):)  Big, muchos relieved... only math on friday and hopefully I will get through that one alright... It's graded on a curve, so that coul be either really good or really bad... depending on what everyone else gets.  hm... we'll see i guess.  going to study hard tomorrow at the house of Mlle impressoniste-extraordinaire (Jocelyn).  Well, must get rested up for my big study day tomorrow! :) just lovely.  Word of the day: palanquin- 'a covered litter for 1 person that is carried on poles on the shoulders of men' (aka: my new method of travel... i just need to find some manservants.)

"       Blogger is seriously messing with my mind. I was all happy and such things as I got home from school today which was unusual, then it made me mad.

            FOUR KINDS OF PEOPLE                                             I am reading a book called ' Who Says Elephants can't Dance ' by Lou Gerstner ( Its about IBM's Magical Turnaround in the 90's ) . Found this interesting piece from there . There are four kinds of people :             THOSE WHO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN            THOSE FOR WHOM THINGS HAPPEN            THOSE WHO WATCH THINGS HAPPEN            THOSE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING .                                                                                ,male
"       Disinfectant by Mazohyst   The old man, lying in his hospital bed,  Waiting for death to carry him away.  The smell of the disinfectant, piercing the senses of the waiting relatives.  Waiting for the moment, waiting for death to carry him away.   Do you regret now?  What you should have said, but have not done?  What you should have done, but have not done?  What awaits you?   The gaping black abyss of the unknown, the place we all go...  When your mother died, you wondered what she felt...  now you feel it yourself...  Is it nice?   The moment approaches.  You see it on the faces of your family.  They stand around the bed...  Looking at you, you, with those tubes sticking out your body.   The young ones, watching in fascination as the heart monitor beats...  Even now, you feel the strain it takes to keep it beating,  waiting for that final moment,  Waiting for death to carry you away.   There... you hear it now  The call to leave.  Your family stands, helpless begging you to stay.  You can't hear it anymore  Your mind, your consciousness, your soul, drifting away into nothing   The droning beep...  heralding your departure  heralding the moment,  that death took you away.

"       Voter disenfranchisement is nothing new. If it weren't for it we would likely have a different man for President now. However, according to Katrina vanden Heuvel, we as a society are far from having the issue addressed, or even making an honest attempt to do so.  In her  urlLink article on the subject , vanden Heuvel describes many attempts by various parties to make it so that those from whom they have little reason to expect any favors do not get to cast their vote.  ...in St. Louis, Missouri, election officials told voter registration workers that of 30,000 applications submitted, two-thirds had been rejected. No reasons were given... While we are on the subject, I would like to say that personally I think in this day and age the very idea of voter registration sounds archaic. Given the technology available, any citizen must be allowed to vote anywhere. Once the data is entered for the citizen, a verification process should be run to ensure the validity of the data. Once that process completes, he or she must be presented with the proper voting form conforming with the local election requirements. All of that can be done electronically, with the proper electronic replication as well as a paper printout. Sounds incredible? Not so, if you compare it with the systems we use everyday, for instance, the ones that allow us to receive instant credit at a bank or to make purchases with a credit card. However, for now we do have the voter registration procedure in place, so lets get back to the issues as they are.  I believe the first major step towards insuring the fairness in the vote count would be creation of a public election oversight commission empowered to oversee everything related to elections,- from the registration procedures to the software code for the systems involved in the election process. The local and federal election oversight bodies are part of their respective governments, and that makes them suspect. Personally, I think all the technology involved must be open source, wherever possible, to avoid tampering by commercial interests.  Those are just a few thoughts that come to mind. Clearly, someone with more election management experience than yours truly can come up with many more good ideas. They need to be discussed and implemented as when found applicable. For, as vanden Heuvel correctly states,  At  stake, isn't simply our choice for America's next president, but also our faith in  our nation's democracy.             ",male
"                 Jeff Jarvis is right. All I can say is:  urlLink Amen, brother .  All the 'visionary' protestors like Michael Moore have no vision. They focus like a laser beam on one problem. They have the proverbial hammer to solve every problem. The world is far too complex to point at a single source of any problem. If you don't like the way things are being run in the country, the problem isn't one man (Bush). The problem isn't even three men (Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft). The problem is much larger, much more complex. Focusing the debate on one man doesn't solve the problem, because fixing that one thing won't fix the problem.   Take stock in the situation. The world changed on its own - Bush didn't change it and neither did Clinton. They don't have the power to do something like that. All they can do is be a player in the game.   Look at the game and figure out how to play it - don't focus so much on the players and figure out how to bring them down. The game will continue without them.             ",male

"                 So I'm getting flamed for suggesting questions for  urlLink the friday five .  What's up with that?  What really irritates me is that I suggested questions which I felt were at least somewhat thoughtful - and then whoever posts them on the site changed them.  So yes, some of them are lame.  But those aren't the ones I suggested.  The questions as I posted them are: 1.  What was the most memorable moment from the last week? 2.  Name someone who has changed your life. 3.  Describe a time you helped someone else without profiting from it. 4.  Name a special teacher who inspired you as a child or adolescent. 5.  Describe a memorable birthday.  However, they were posted as: 1. What was your most memorable moment from the last week? *2. What one person touched your life this week? *3. How have you helped someone this week? *4. What one thing do you need to get done by this time next week? *5. What one thing will you do over the next seven days to make your world a better place? Those with an asterisk are slightly if not COMPLETELY different.  It just frustrates me.  I'm thrilled that they used my ideas - but not thrilled that they changed them almost completely and still put my url up.  Oh well.  I guess I'll just say  thanks for the hits  and stop my whingeing.  On a bright note, N and I are going into the city tonight - we're staying at the super posh (or so it seems) Omni Hotel,  then going to a cooking class at  urlLink NoMI  Saturday morning,  then coming home.  It should be a nice night!  We went to NoMI on our honeymoon - it was absolutely amazing.  Quite possibly the best lunch ever.  So I'm really looking forward to it.

"       Seeing as everyone on Habbo Forum has started a blog, I thought I'd start one as it seems interesting. Today I had Humanities in the morning and my teacher kept spitting in people's faces when she talked, luckily I was at the back. I got in trouble from her, cos I was doodling in my book a picture of an angel. One that was really angelic. I have that picture in my homework diary, cause it seems special to me. I don't really think of it as a doodle, more like a work of art. Can't scan it in cause my scanner's broken, what a drag! Then I had English and watched Frankenstein. It featured the proper story of Frankenstein, not the green monster one. I hate the fact about people calling the monster Frankenstein, when really it was his creator who name was Frankenstein. As soon as the bell rang, I was straight out of there, but I knocked a couple of class textbooks and couldn't be bothered to pick them up. Got told off for that cause I walked off ignoring me teacher. At morning break I found out that one of my mates, Frank had a haircut. I liked his hair when it was really long, but now he had it cut like one of the Beatles. What a drag! I'm gonna grow it like that, definately. Not the Beatle styled hair, but the long hair. Like Kurt Cobain. And even though I'm 13, I'm shaving. I'm growing a gotee like Kurt Cobain, man he rocks! When break was finished, I went to my IT Class, for you Americans, that's Computers. I couldn't be bothered to start learning touch-type so I went on www.rathergood.co.uk to play a Sonic The Hedgehog flash game, which resembled to a improved version of Sonic Advance. Then I had Science when IT finished. That's when I got in big trouble! In my Chemistry Experiment, I had to put an Universal Indicator in different liquids like shampoo to find out their pH and if they were acid or alkali and how weak/strong they were. My lab partner who's a fat greasy slimeball who enjoys sitting i na chair and laugh like a mouse at passer-by's was holding the test tube full of yogurt. I got the indicator and squeezed it into the tube, then I turned round to shout abuse at the class idiot who was currently blabbing on to Chris, a thickhead. The indicator started dripping on my lab partner's hand and he didn't even notice it until he felt loads of burning. Then I realised that I wasn't holding an Universal Indicator but I was holding an Acid! My lab partner suffered severe burns on his hand and I had detention on every Wednesday lunchtime for a month, and I'm grounded upstairs with my darling computer. Anyway, at lunchtime the school canteen was closed, so everyone sat outside chatting, well the girls did... Most girls sat in the basketball court outside. As it happens, I was playing basketball with my mates and telling them about what happened in Science, when I decided to throw the ball behind me. It hit the Headmaster/Principal. How bad. Mega Bad. I got a yellow slip delivered to my form tutor. let me explain, when something good/bad happens, slips are sometimes delivered to my tutor. The best are Orange slips which are delivered for good reasons. Blue slips are delivered for improvement on things like behaviour and work, I only got one of them last year >:D. Yellow slips are for bad incidents and Red slips are for really bad things. I got 1 more yellow slip for burning my partner's hand muwahahaha. After lunchtime, I had maths with this teacher who picks on pupils who aren't looking at the board, just staring into some random item or doodling. I was one of them, she asked me what was the squeare root of 64. i know it was 8 but I just said Dunno cause I couldn't be bothered to answer the question. The teacher said 'Max, if you keep saying dunno any more in all my maths lessons with you, you will be given detention'. How dumb is that? Mega dumb! After that I had D.T my last lesson of the day. I did cooking and I made some butter scones. Then I left all my cooking utensils out and I made some idiot clear it up. When I went out of chool, I ate up all my 6 scones and then I got out my skateboard and started skating home. The road my school is on has a very steep slope. Riding a bike on it is realy dangerous, skateboarding and rollerskating too, but skateboarding on it is like hellishly extreme! I skated down shouting hell yeah, this is quick! My mates saw me skating down there and shouted Go max go! I felt cool, as if I was Tony Hawk. As I was skating down, a group of girls were blocking my way. I shouted move out of the f***ing way you b****es but they shouted Whatever without even looking behind them. So I continued skating down and knocked one of them over. Serves them right, look before you make a decision... Now I'm here typing my first entry to my extra-fantiscular cool...sculer blog! I'll be going out to my local Youth Club tonight to mingle with a group of hot girls! Proper Bo I tell thee! I'm listening to a big collection of Red Hot Chili Peppers albums on Winamp including By The Way, One Hot Minute, Mother's Milk and Californication. Red Hot Chili Peppers are my favourite, period.

"       It's really, really hard to describe, you know. All in one Thursday, I went from the ringing of cell phones, the irritation of irritated people demanding too many things, the hassle of 'don't forget anything', and then I got in a car with Ashley, and drove to your house. Normally the drive to your house is a brief, mocking pause before I reconnect to wires and resume work. Working late into the night - certainly past your bedtime - only to finally close things down. By then, you're either asleep or we're both too exhausted to do anything but mumble tender words as we drift off to sleep. But on Thursday night, the drive was so charged. Almost palpable, Ashley and I could feel the tension, feel the exhilaration of going away. The drive up brought good news about an important race. A good way to start. I felt very nervous sitting next to you. Actually, I am usually nervous near you. I was so glad to be going away with you. I needed to have you all to myself, to have the chance to shamelessly - almost selfishly - hold onto you. Often I worry when I show that side. (Having dated more than one clinger, I know how quickly the person putting up with the clinginess finds that their passion turns to tolerance which in turn becomes annoyance. Incidentally, sometimes you seem to vacillate between subtle tolerance and subtle annoyance) All the same, as hectic and preoccupied as you and I normally are, I was sore and wanting you. Hungry in my heart, and almost as hungry in my body. Hunger in the heart is different than stomach hunger. With stomach hunger you can very quickly eat, and very quicly become full. That fullness can last for much much longer a period of time than it takes to eat. It is exactly opposite in matters of the heart, where it can sometimes take a very long time to become full, and one cool word can make it empty again. You are a very focused traveler. (You do not enjoy the experience, I think, and you are more about end goals than the process. How funny. I haven't had the chance to watch you in such extensive travel. I find it amusing how closely it parallels your professional agenda.) So we very quickly got off to Philadelphia. Perhaps I should rephrase that: you got off very quickly in Philadephia. So began the most relaxing week of my life: waking leisurely. taking turns cooking. beach swims in the morning. island exploration through the day. relaxed evenings of reading, smoking, drinking, star-watching, card-playing, bug swatting, cooking, eating out, being close, sunburns (that turned into more lotioned-back-massages than a group of non-swingers ought to have been privy to), suntans, drives through dense vegetation, seeing horses walking down the street. All of it set off - deeply accentuated - by being so close to you. Leaving there - actually walking out of the house - was very hard for me. See, I knew that the only thing waiting for me - for us - on the other side of 15 hours of travel was our old habits of hurry, annoyance, hiding, work, more work, and separation. Old routines like one and two sentence emails that we squeeze out between gargantuan workloads, short phone calls that say good night and little more, pretending around Tom that I didn't really spend the night and we didn't really do anything, but most of all, being lonely for your affection. It seems you, too, are an easy habit to get into. And I get the feeling that I may be an easy habit to get into, but I am an equally easy habit to break. And now that we're back and you've spent the whole night and day there and I've spent the whole night and day here, I opened my computer to talk to you. Because I miss you. Because I love you. Mostly because I just wanted to talk to you. The vacation in Vieques was absolutely the nicest thing that anyone has ever given me. (Except for a pair of gloves my dad gave me when I was very little, but that is a different story) You worked so hard to plan and plan everything. It was a perfect break for me. It was perfectly orchestrated. The location, the weather, the house, the company, the time with you. Everything. Except I'm afraid the trip may have spoiled me. Having been so content, so happy having unlimited access to you, it is going to be difficult, being back. So, this is my thank you note to you. Yes, thanking you for the vacation. Yes, thanking you for a great time. But mostly, love this is me thanking you for the pure, unfiltered happiness I feel when I bask in your presence, under your affection, glowing from your little tiny expressions of love. This is me thanking you for a perfect week of joy. I love you,          ",female

"    yawn,....yesterday I had to go to Tampa, we went to the mall since this mall in Sarasota sucks! Anyway, ya, i bought some stuff, clothes, and today im going shopping again at the lil mall. ya, so at the mall, when we were close to being finished, the alarm goes off in the store. Okay well you think i'd be used to it because in HCMS the fire alarms are like Super loud but these matched it. So when we finally pay, we walk out of the store and it turns out that every alarm in the mall is going off! It was just one huge beeeeeeeeeeep at that time mixed together with all the little beeps in each store. We went into spencers while the alarms were still going off, but you couldnt hear them in there due to the loud music...i like the workers there now, i mean, they blasted good music so you dont have to listen to the shrieking. lol, ya but then we left&nbsp;and got home around 9:30 ish.    I watched the new Degrassi, Emma kicked Alex's a$$ lol, it was a good fight haha. Ok well i guess thats it and Ryan finally wrote in his blog...its about time!!   ",female

"                  Langoor Ke Mooh Mein Angoor-A Critical Analysis   Well... i have been  in Bangalore since the past 20 days and have been doing what most men candidly admit ..LETCHING.. The twins MG and Brigade Roads being my favourite(..rather only) haunts..During my many visits to the place i cudnt but help notice how most of the girls came with their boyfirends in tow. While the girls were of exceptional beauty the guys were well....,i wudnt say too many complimentary things about their looks.Invariably the oft repeated ,worn out phrase-Langoor ke mooh mein Angoor' would slip outta my mouth.  Intuitvely and quantitatively i realsied that this was possible only because of one reason:The number of handsome guys was far less that the number of beautiful girls.Hence the famous saying always came true.Some might argue that i wudnt have noticed the goodlooking men coz i was too busy staring at the women (safely esconsced on the 'usual side of the fence'..-).But give it a thought this could be the most quantitative reason.  My friends say im off better at looking at the qualitative aspect of things so i gave it a thought.Once they are 15 and 16 gurlz tend to start longing for love and romance.That is the reaon why incompetent actors like Sharukh Khan and mediocre boy bands like Backstreet Boyz have so many fans.For guys this longing starts at a later age because they are busy playing cricket in the streets and miss the silly points , midwickets and deep gullies.  Most men(boys) and women(girls),who are single tend to pine for a good relationship (thought they might not admit it )by the time they are 22 -23 ish...everybody would like to fall in love go around whisper sweet nothings.  Who wouldnt want to be treated specially by someone .So when someone though not strikingly handsome shows a reasonable amount of interest and is willing to listen to you and you would genuinely want to share stuff,looks go out of the window.  Well i dunno how many would agree with me but id like to read the reactions....its one my homespun theories. But one question lingers on how long will i be writing theories about relationships .Id end up being a cheap imitation of Woody Allen.Guess itll stop or take a turn for the better when im no longer just a neutral observer. I hope atleast the 'langoor....' phrase works in the case of ..'yours truly'        ",male

"                  Heh    urlLink The Bush administration  predicts record $455,000,000,000.00 deficit.  In words that is 'a four hundred and fifty five billion dollar deficit'.  The funny part is that, that is the amount they've over spent  for this year alone .  By next year they say it will be up to $475 Billion.  Naturally they have a fiscal plan to reduce the deficit to $226 Billion by 2008.  It might be worth it to suggest at this point that the Bush administration's financial strategy for the US is flawed at the absolute best.    They cite 'the war on terrorism' for the massive overspending.  If the American people buy that argument, they'll easily be led to believe that the Bush administration's hands were tied, and they had no choice but to go to war with Iraq.  I can hear Bush at the podium now:  'We didn't ask to be attacked on 9/11.  That's when this all started.  We had a financial plan that set the country on a track of prosperity, but because they attacked us, we were forced to defend ourselves.  Defence costs a lot of money, but we had no choice but to spend it.  Iraq was simply an extension of the war on terrorism.  We weren't even given the choice 'should we attack Iraq or not', that choice was already made for us on 9/11 by those terrorists.  It's the terrorists' fault that we are overspent.'  And of course there's this.  'We gave him a chance to allow the inspectors in, and he wouldn't let them in.'  From an  urlLink article in Salon  today.  The author points out that Bush thinks the world gave Hussein a chance to re-admit the arms inspectors to Iraq, and it was Hussein who refused to admit them to the country.  Remember when that happened?  I know it was a few months ago but surely you remember when Hussein made his impassioned speech to the world, defying the United Nations and insisting that any UN weapons inspector who set foot on Iraqi soil will be shot dead and publicly eviscerated on the spot.  Remember that?  Remember when all that happened?  Yeah,  urlLink neither do I .  But Bush remembers.  His memory is quite clear 'We gave him a chance to allow the inspectors in, and he wouldn't let them in.'  Which leaves the question open: 'What does the world look like through George Bush's eyes?  What does George Bush believe happened in the world over the past year?'  The American people are the first people in history to elect a semi-retarded man as their representative.  They should be commended for giving mentally challenged people a chance to step forward and show that they can do a super job.               ",male
"         I cut off all my hair today.      GASP!!!      Ok, so not allllll of it. Just the back. And the sides. Oh, and he gave me bangs. Something I've never had.     Most men I know freak out over the whole 'hair or no hair' issue. I had long hair for a majority of my life. When I was 16, I walked into the salon and told the lady to cut my shoulder length curls into a tight Pixie cut. She refused until I threatened to call her manager over. haha.      I've had short hair ever since. Sometimes it's a longer version of a bob. Other times, I just simply chop it.           My first semster in college, I buzzed my hair. Every girl on my floor thought I was a lesbian. That is until my dorm attentdant, whose nickname 'Moose' fit her to a T, walked in on me and my boyfriend. Ahem. I think she wanted to ask me out. EEEEE Gads!!!      So see? At least one guy was diggin' my Freedom Phase. :)          I'm now sporting a stylish, punk / professional hair cut. Big kudos to my step brother who not only A) cut it into a great style, but B) got it straight! woo hoo!      Gone are my summer curls! Well, for the moment. Once I wash my hair, the curls will return, much to my dismay.           I feel so much better. I don't think men realize the power of a great haircut and manicure. I did however trade off on him 'practicing' his 'dramatic' make up techniques on me.      Joe has recently been working with many of Nashville's up & coming stars. He does their hair, makeup, etc for photo shoots, album covers , and whatever big event they have planned (Dove awards, CMA awards, blah blah).      So when he mentions : I need to work on my 'Dolly Parton' look, I'm already freakin' out.      And what exactly is the 'Dolly Parton' look?      Whatever it was, I wasn't stickin around to figure it out.           His next request was that we need to 'get my ass into the salon for a new color.'      I don't know about y'all but I personally like my chesnut colored hair with it's few strands of blonde streaks.      I'm not ready for a whole 'new' color.      Lord knows what it would be either. Knowing my luck, he'd turn it dark Red, or God forbid Black. Hmm...          Looking forward to greeting the day with my friends shouts of ' OH MY GAWD YOU CUT YOUR HAIR!!!'      I like it.

"                   I am working on learning how to handle my fear. Fear tends to grip my heart in a vise and keep my mind from functioning on any kind of rational level. Fear has been, it seems like, how I have lived my whole life. However, now that I have allowed God in control of my life, I no longer have to live in or with fear. My God is a God of love, not of fear, and He will help me conquer my fear if I just allow Him too.      When I start to feel fear, I have to be willing to look inside myself and discover what the driving force behind the fear is. Yes I know it will be scary. Yes I know it will be hard. However I also know I do not have to face my fear alone. God will be with me, holding my hand, carrying me if necessary and loving me every step of the way.       When I look at the fear, I need to remember all the above and calm myself down enough to find out what is feeding the fear. It could be a fear of abandonment, a fear that has happened over and over again in my life and what I am always dreading when someone is in my life. God can conquer that fear, He will never abandon me. It could be a fear of rejection, one I have also faced most of my life and one that can destroy my life in a split second. God can conquer this fear, He will never reject me. It could be a fear of failure, the one fear that has stopped me from living life to it’s fullest cause I don’t want to fail, so I don’t risk at all. God can conquer this fear, He made me and He does not make failures. It could be the fear of being unloveable, which since for so long I could not even love myself, how could I expect someone else to love me? God conquered this fear, He loved me enough to allow His Son to die for me.       I know when God looks at me all He sees is love. I need to look at the fear and know in my heart it is not true, for my God tells me it is not true. God does not want me to fear anything. So when I discover fears starting to overcome me again, I need to remember to calm down, find the root, and then with God’s help, cut it out. God will help me fight both the emotions of fear and the beliefs that lead me to fear. He will show me I need not fear, not now, not tomorrow, not ever. With His love and help I know I can conquer all my fears. Not in a day, not in a week I am sure, but over time I know I will. I believe in Him and He is not of fear. This is one of the million reasons I love my God - He governs not by fear but by love. Vlh 7/26          ",female

"                  For those of you who don't know, I got a finally job last week.  I will be an overnight stocker at the local  urlLink Wal-Mart .  I know it doesn't really sound like any kind of dream job, but in a weird way, it sort of is for me.  I have been wanting to try being an overnight stocker at a retail store for a while.  I was almost one when I worked at Builders Square, but they ended up changing the shift to start at like 5am!  So I just took another shift.  I think the overnight stocker position sounds fun though.  There won't be as many customers around, and it just sounds like it would be cool to get paid to stay up all night.  I have never been happy about having to start working at 7 or 8 in the morning.  Plus, the overnight positions get paid $1 an hour more than the other positions.  I start my new job tonight at 10pm, and I will be working until 7am.  I just hope that I can stay awake.  Last night I stayed up until 4:30 or 5:00am so that I could sleep in later today and be as rested as possible for work tonight.  I'm still not sure how well I will adjust to this new schedule.  The way I see it, I have almost the same schedule as my dad and brother.  But instead of working or going to school from 7am until about 4pm, I am sleeping.  And instead of sleeping from 10pm to 7am, I am working.  I just hope that my body agrees with this theory.  I am pretty nervous about starting my job tonight.  One reason is that it's new, and I always get nervous when I start something new.  I am also nervous because I still don't know exactly what I will be doing.  I mean, I get the basic idea, but I still don't know all of the details about my job yet.  I am also worried that the sudden change in schedule will come as quite a shock to me.  I'm used to doing pretty much nothing all day.  Now I will only have a few hours of free time every day.  I'm sure that it won't take too long to get used to though.  It never has before.  But then again, this is the longest amount of time that I have ever spent doing nothing before.  I am just happy to have some kind of job.  I really really needed to start working and make some money.  I know that it was God that gave me this job, and I am extremely thankful.  I am going to try really hard to make the most out of this opportunity.  Who knows, this may end up being the most fun job I've ever had!               ",male

The truth is, we suspect, deep down inside, that God really couldn’t care less. And we’d rather not face that suspicion, or the disappointment of hoping and not having an answer, so we insulate ourselves with weak desire, small hopes - easy prayers.   -Bob Hyatt http://www.theooze.com/articles/article.cfm?id=790         ",female

"       so today i went to mavs hoop camp. ive been going all this week, and tomorrows the last day of it, thank goodness. all the kids there are younger than i am, except theres like 3 other 16-year-olds. and for some reason ive been feeling REALLY lazy all week and so ive been playing like crap. but we still get to meet mavs players and stuff so thats cool. on tuesday scott williams came and visited. hes soooo nice. and today shawn bradley and eddie najera came. eddie went one on one with lots of kids, it was tiiiight. hes such a pimp. he was playing against this one kid,&nbsp; and&nbsp;everyone else was sitting there watching, and his sweat FLUNG all over me, it was very disgusting. but after camp i came home and showered and now im&nbsp;about to eat dinner. im probly just gonna end up watching BIG FISH tonight at mi casa because everyone else seems to be busy. and hopefully ill read tonight. i have this stack of books in my room that im trying to read this summer, and i made a huge dent in it at the beginning of summer, but ive been slowing down. i need to pick up the pace. but tomorrow is FINALLY the last day of camp! we have 5 on 5 and 3 on 3 tournaments all day and thats pretty cool i guess, except my 5 on 5 team sucks. anyways, last night i went to bob rehm's house for our pike party thing. we all brought our pictures that we had developed and chatted for a while. then courtney and i drove over to magic mike's and met spenser, catherine, and mary and we all drove to this snowcone stand where we met zack, tyson, chelsea, and hailey. i had this vanilla cream snowcone...it was SOOOO good. i&nbsp;definitely recommend it. by the time we were done eating and talking it was like 10:15 and most of our curfews were 11, so we left. but there was&nbsp;a bit of mishap in courtneys truck because spenser called 'shotgun', but naturally, i called 'shotgun joust' and then beat him to the car door. but then he wouldnt give me the front seat so we finally tried to resolve the matter by fighting for it. and, actually, after a LONG time, courtney suggested that we play rock-paper-scissors for it, 2 out of 3. so we did, and guess who won? brenna! and after a little more bickering by mr samms, i finally got my seat in the front. you see, i didnt really want the SEAT, it was more of a pride thing. so that was a good ending to an okay day. so yeah this weeks been reallllly slow because of camp, and next week i leave for san antonio with my dad! ill definitely be wearing some MAVERICKS attire...SPURS SUCK (even though, in reality, theyre going to be wow good this year)! adios!

"             Dear Greg,  Thanks.  Thanks for being the kind of player who I could love even when I really, really hated the team you played most of your career with.  The Braves handed my team, the Pirates, the most crushing postseason loss of my fanhood, and at the end of the day, I still really liked you.  Thanks for wanting to win and being super competitive without throwing bats at people and storming around the field like a madman.  You've always done your talking with your arm and glove and not with your mouth.  Man, that is rare today.  Thanks for embracing role the of The Professor, something most most athletes would hate.  Thanks for wearing your glasses when you're not pitching.  Hey, it's a small thing, but this bespectacled girl thought it was cool (and still does).  Thanks for being friends with the pitching staff that you pitched 10+ years with.  I don't expect every athlete to be bestest friends with their teammates, but it is awfully nice when it does happen.  Can I come golfing with you, Tom, and John some time?  Thanks for not really caring that people tend to overappreciate Roger Clemens and underappreciate you.  Roger's heat is more attention grabbing than your pinpoit control and pitch variation, but I don't think you care.  Most people say they would take Roger as a starter over you, but I don't think you care about that either.  When Roger got win number 300 we had weeks of countdowns, constant media coverage, and story after story in magazine after magazine.  When you got close to 300 we didn't get much at all.  When you GOT 300 you STILL didn't get much at all.  But I don't think you care because in the end, your team got the win that day.  Thanks for being so great for so long.  Sure, some of that is beyond your control - you've only been on the DL ONCE in your career!  But here's a couple fun facts that you might not even know.  Not one player who played in your first win (Sept. 7, 1986) is still playing.  None of the other 12 winning pitchers that day is still pitching.  You've had sixteen (!) 15 win seasons.  For nine straight seasons you had a walk ratio lower than 2 per nine innings.  Amazing.  Thanks for not coming out to tip your hat after your 300th win because it wasn't your home ballpark and you didn't think it was respectful to the other team's fans.  I don't know that they really would've had a problem with it, Greg, but most athletes wouldn't have been able to see that moment as anything but theirs so you definitely get points for thinking beyond yourself.  And most of all - probably above all else - thanks for just being a good guy.  I've never had to read a story about your sexual escapades, your adventures with drugs and alcohol, your anger management problems, or your cancerous attitude in the clubhouse.  Your coaches seem to like you, and your teammates seem to like you even more.  You've always gone out to the mound, thrown the ball, and then gone home.  And I love you for it.  Thanks, Heather              ",female

"        Nowadays   is an adverb that means 'at the present time' or 'these days.' It is used primarily to show contrast between a period, state or situation in the present that is different from the past.

"   Ok, so last night my phone goes off at like 2AM. I'm half asleep and not coherent, and I fumble for this thing in the dark with a bunch of new crap everywhere to bang into. I grab the phone to shut it up, and don't realize it is actually a phone call at this point. I open it, and read the name, it's says 'ex's cell', two things run through my head, first, I thought I deleted his number, and second, this is an actual phone call, so I hit the end button. I didn't want to talk, I know it was a drunk dial, and the last thing I need is him giving me a bunch of bs over the phone, I got enough of that before the breakup, I'm moving on, don't need the drama, thanks but no thanks, really.  So I hung it up, and turned the ringer to silent, I normally don't like turning my phone ringer off for emergency purposes, but I wanted to sleep and I'll be damned if I was going to let him wake me up again, definitely not worth it. Drunk dials from my friends are fine, but not from the ex when I need sleep. I just don't want or need the drama, call me crazy, but I've moved on, and I wish he would to. Being vindictive on the phone while your drunk does not show strength. It shows how juvenile and weak you really are. I've got big things going on in my life right now and the last thing I need is him trying to drag me down. I've cried the tears, and I'm done. I don't miss him, honestly I miss the idea of someone, the support that comes with it, the tenderness that exists. When that is gone, there is nothing left to miss.  I was sifting through things yesterday, and I went through all my old pictures, bad bad bad. Went through all the exes, and I mean ALL of them. Out of all of them only one do I still call my friend, and only one do I sorta regret loosing (last college love). I wouldn't call them mistakes, because the funny thing is I don't regret or begrudge any of them. I guess one can say they were all learning experiences, life lessons if you will. Maybe that's why I don't feel the need for the drama, it's over, I'm better for having known them, and I move on. My guy pal from school said something to me Wednesday night that I've never heard a guy say to me, 'I believe it'll all work out for everyone, magic, dreams, romance, it will all come to you when the time is right.' I've always believed in that, in dreams, magic, romance, imagination, in short that's why I'm such a Disney fanatic. I still believe that, 'someday my prince will come.' That's why I'm not sad anymore, that's why I don't need the drama, I know that my somebody is out there somewhere and when the time is really right I'll find him, or he'll find me. Until then I'll just keep doing my thing, selfish, yeah, but I have to worry about me first, because nobody else is going to do it for me. Until next time.  ",female

"       the  urlLink oldest-looking pragmatist  i've  urlLink seen  yet: [on copy protection mechanisms] 'That is the wrong approach. The only way to survive in this moving and evolving world is to grow and evolve with it.' note, however, that he does not sport any wrinkles.   for the past few days, i have eaten at a fast food restaurant. it's not that i like to gorge myself and my arteries with an impressive array of 'suicide foods', but i'm already sick of hawker centre food. i have eaten at every store, from the one that sells the mee rebus with the cheap, diluted gravy, to the famous noodle store manned by this hippie in his sixties who sports hair as oily as his lard-infested soup and who swaggers as he scoops sauces into inferior plastic bowls. and when he gets the chance to loaf, he sits on the table adjacent to his store, drinks plain carbonated water and just inhales a whole fag, all the time making assorted references to the human anatomy, especially the part or parts between the legs. (i think he *does* sell chicken leg noodles, but i bet those are unpopular.)  hence my visit to the most apparent contribution of western culture to obesity in developed countries. such a label is quickly dissolved in whatever they use to fry the freedom fries the moment you talk to the cashier.  one time i asked -- not knowing exactly what McName (tm) it was -- for an orange flavoured soft drink they call mcfizz (they could have rebranded coca-cola and marked up the price five times, and teenagers would still buy it), and the girl at the counter looked at me as if 'soft drink' was an expletive in a bizarro world (i am not a fan of comic books). in the end the girl blurted why i didn't ask for 'orange juice and that sprite', and the manager next to her whitened in absolute astonishment.   'you mix that cheap orange juice with sprite into this tiny cup and sell it for the combined price for both?' (in the end, i did not make the purchase.) then the people in the queue did seem to have rather disgusted expressions, but all was ok after about fifteen seconds and singaporeans continued to be cheated by a world-renowned restaurant that mocks people with clowns and some purple creature (not a monster because he is smiling, and he's got purple fur).   today was different -- i went there because y begged for a 'cheap' meal (they are giving out those discount coupons outside the MRT today) after paying for my last three twenty-dollar meals (which i earned fair and square, mind you). and that turned out to be a mistake. behold:   'buying this coupon, ah?' 'err, ya.' (in mandarin) 'do you want the dessert or the fries?' (in very poor mandarin) 'i'll take the dessert.' (goes to the dessert dispensing machine for a moment and returns with a cup of cream with chocolate on top) 'eh, you want de hot fart or de storberry ah?' 'hot what?!' (frustrated) 'fart lah! hot fart! hot fart!'  that exchange continued until y figured out that she was talking about 'hot fudge'. and even then it's not exactly the finest example of 'hot'. so remember: if you ask for a hot fart, note that what you ask is not what you will get.

Elwood came up to me yesterday evening and said that the sermon was my best yet.   i hope that doesn't mean i need to keep making them long.   visited shirley and pete for the first time this afternoon while taking them lunch.  shirley fell a couple of weeks ago but didn't tell ANYONE.  actually didn't want to go to the hospital, even though she heard her ankle crack on her way down (as she fell).  correction: they DID tell their youngest son, who lives in Urbanna, but also swore him to secrecy.  the sisters and older brother were all consequently angry at him for keeping the secret.  their granddaughter in Topeka was getting married this past saturday, so they drove out over a 3 day period (1,400 miles one way).  kept the leg elevated, but it still didn't do it any GOOD, according to the doctor.  it was good to get to know her and them a little better.  pete doesn't come ... though somewhere in the back of my mind i seem to remember his visiting once over the last year ... not sure though.  their granddaughter graduated highschool at 15, college at 19, and med school will be this coming saturday.  she's 24.  her father is a heart surgeon, her mom (shirley's daughter) raises horses.    harvey's sister passed away last night.  viewing is tomorrow evening, funeral wednesday 1 PM at totuskey.  Margaret, though she was sitting up, doesn't look that good.  she is still confined to the bed and the wheelchair.  i suspect there is more going wrong with her than just the fungal meningitis would account for.    there's a sparrow that builds her nest in the front door right-side wreath every spring. this year there were 5 eggs.  all hatched. one chick fell out, but i put it back. she still cared for it.  apparently they don't reject babies that have been touched by humans after all.  the chicks are getting bigger and bigger.  their feathers finally started to come out overnight on saturday.  they now look up at me and just stare.  it's been fascinating to watch them grow.  don't see the mama ... or rather, don't startle the mama away that much anymore.  apparently she's spending more time gathering food away from the nest.    they should probably be ready to fly in another week or two ... max.   theological reflections?    nah. i got nothin'. :-)  Kori and Anna Kiss spoke last night at family night, about their ... trek ... their ... pilgrimage from Hungary and Romania, respectively, to Budapest and the international baptist lay academy, then to prague for the international baptist seminary, then being told they had to find another school, since all the faculty was being fired from that one (another form of ethnic cleansing, if you ask me).. and ended up at BTSR in richmond and then ended up being called to pastor Bethany church in Callao, VA.

"   Well, I've posted some preliminary images ... I guess I should say something in more detail. I figure a good place to start is general geography - a non-specific lay of the land. Cities and landmarks have yet to be set down with any real detail, so here's just a few notes on climate and scenery and so on and so forth.  The explored (thus known) part of the world consists of a grouping of semi-isolated 'islands' of various size, ranging from simple outcroppings of dry rock to stretches of terrain large enough to be considered a decent-sized state or a very small country. I call these rocky places islands for lack of a better name ... they are all, in reality, very high plateaus of rock surrounded not by a sea of water, but by a sea of thick, strangely fluid, and somewhat magical mist. While the mist is not harmful in itself, it is a severe impairment to vision, cannot be traveled over by normal means,  etc. and seems to be a permanent cloudy covering over whatever lies below the plateaus.  The air is thin and dry. Water is available, but not abundant. Only hardy trees, plants, and crops grow on the surface; growing in enough variety to be interesting and nutritional. Animals tend to be small, with the largest predators in the food chain being aviary (large birds, drakes, etc.).  Rivers and lakes and streams exist on the larger plateaus, and sometimes rush over the edges and fall into the mist with very little sound.   Below the misty barrier is mostly unexplored. Those who have traveled down into the clingy fog have usually not lived to come back. Barely below the surface of the mist a variety of scraggly, tough trees jut out of the vertical rock faces, eeking out an existence in the high elevations. Further down into the mist grows an entire jungle. How far below is unknown. Only occasionally has the mist parted in places to reveal a brilliant, alien green-ness that simply shouldn't be growing underneath such a thick, blinding covering. Under the mist is warm and damp, nearly suffocating with humidity to those so used to the arid plateaus.   Mist/jungle flora and fauna are barely documented, and the exact depth until the surface of the world itself has yet to be discovered ... or at least reported. It is likely that large predators live in the jungle, and there are old stories of dragons surfacing from the mist in days long-past. There is only one known intelligent race to live in the jungles, and these mysterious humanoids are viewed with quite a bit of fearful superstition among the supposedly more 'civilized' plateau-dwellers. Whether or not they are demons or otherwise is currently unknown, since there is no shared language and encounters are few and far-between.  Above the mists, in a similar fashion to our own planet [with changes depending on latitude] there are definite seasons, with winter being noteworthy for its dry, bitter cold and summer being marked by rain that tends to blur the boundaries between rock and mist. There's one sun and probably a few moons (two or three; I haven't decided yet).   The mist was not always around. That much I have decided. How'd it get there? Hmm ... Stay tuned! ",female

"           Remember that thing on my back that moved in and decided to make my back numb and make me freak out? No? Well, that happened in early June. And guess what? It came back. There’s no doubt that it is in the exact same spot, so unless we have some spiders that are obsessive compulsive, I don’t think that it’s a spider bite.  So mum took me to the doctor to get it checked out. Seriously, I am so sick of going to that place. It’s headaches, it’s my weight, it’s my back, it’s my allergies, it’s blah blah blah blah. My regular doctor wasn’t there so I got to meet with this really cool Jewish guy. Dr... Brody, I think. He looked at it and didn’t know what it was. So he went and got another doctor to get a second opinion. The reason they thought it wasn’t a spider bite was because it didn’t hurt or itch at all, it showed up in the exact same spot twice, and the way it felt wasn’t like normal bites. So I never really got a clear answer on what it was. But he thought there was some kind of fluid inside it so he cut it open to drain it. It’s really icky.  So that was... what? Wednesday? Yes. The discoloration is still there, but it isn't swelled up or anything. If it comes back, I swear to God, I'm going to do something. Yeah, I'll do something. I know what you're saying. 'Oh, he's lazy. He won't do anything.' But if you think that, you'll be wrong. Because I....  Jesus, I'm glad I stopped myself on that one. I had about three more paragraphs worth of the rambles.  I saw The Village. I don't get why everybody hates it. I mean, yes, it wasn't that scary. Perhaps overall the trailers for the film were scarier than the movie itself, which was misleading to some. But I loved it. I loved it just as much as The Sixth Sense, and Signs, and most of all, Unbreakable. Unbreakable is my favorite M. Night movie, even though it wasn't scary at all. I love it because it's a great story. It's fiction, but it's presented in a realistic fashion. The directing was trés chouette. That's what The Village was. There were a couple parts in the movie that made me think the ending was going to be horrible, but that went away when the ending finally came. And all the questions and disagreements I had with the story were answered at the end.  But it was good. I say it was good, and so it is. Why didn't you guys like it? (Answers would be very nice.)

"             Some notes on Mars Blog: I knew when I started that this was a little too involved of a project than I was willing to put the effort in for, but I went ahead with it anyway, because, what the hell, it's only a blog.  Not too much lost if I give up or fail.  Jim S. has hinted at wanting to keep a  character journal on the same blog as Laika.  I would very much like other writers on the Mars Blog.  I'm afraid that if I just write it by myself that it will disappear in a month or so.  Some guidelines, actually the only guideilines, is that I'd like to keep it believable.  (Even though I'm hinting in my last post of a martian ecosystem beneath the surface, that doesn't necessarily mean that will happen.)  Major issues that would affect everyone, should probably be bounced around a little first.)  Also the writing should have a reason for being on Mars.  I would rather not have a Deep Space Nine on my hands that is just a soap opera that could be just as easily in Beverly Hills instead of Mars.  That all said, anyone who wants to start up their own character is cool with me to give it a shot for as long as they want to keep it up.  If you want your character in a different city, career... all that's probably preferable, but I'd like to at least keep the time and dates for posts sychronized somewhat.  I'll send a copy of the number of days in each month and an explanation of time units on Mars for those who are interested in writing. Basically you can look at the date and just add one day if you are posting on the next day in our time.  It sounds like a huge effort to get involved in, but no love will be lost for anyone who starts and quits or writes incredibly bad or anything.  The readers don't have to know who is writing what character story either.  It will be your show, it's just for fun.  I hope some take me up on the offer.            ",male

"             John Nichols, the nation magazine   urlLink http://www.thenation.com/thebeat/    Bill Moyers' Presidential Address  06/09/2003 @ 10:27am   E-mail this Post  Democratic presidential candidates were handed a dream audience of 1,000 'ready-for-action' labor, civil rights, peace and economic justice campaigners at the Take Back America conference organized in Washington last week by the Campaign for America's Future. And the 2004 contenders grabbed for it, delivering some of the better speeches of a campaign that remains rhetorically -- and directionally -- challenged. But it was a non-candidate who won the hearts and minds of the crowd with a 'Cross of Gold' speech for the 21st century.   Recalling the populism and old-school progressivism of the era in which William Jennings Bryan stirred the Democratic National Convention of 1896 to enter into the great struggle between privilege and democracy -- and to spontaneously nominate the young Nebraskan for president -- journalist and former presidential aide Bill Moyers delivered a call to arms against 'government of, by and for the ruling corporate class.'   Condemning 'the unholy alliance between government and wealth' and the compassionate conservative spin that tries to make 'the rape of America sound like a consensual date,' Moyers charged that 'rightwing wrecking crews' assembled by the Bush Administration and its Congressional allies were out to bankrupt government. Then, he said, they would privatize public services in order to enrich the corporate interests that fund campaigns and provide golden parachutes to pliable politicians. If unchecked, Moyers warned, the result of these machinations will be the dismantling of 'every last brick of the social contract.'   'I think this is a deliberate, intentional destruction of the United States of America,' said Moyers, as he called for the progressives gathered in Washington -- and for their allies across the United States -- to organize not merely in defense of social and economic justice but in order to preserve democracy itself. Paraphrasing the words of Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president rallied the nation to battle against slavery, Moyers declared, 'Our nation can no more survive as half democracy and half oligarchy than it could survive half slave and half free.'   There was little doubt that the crowd of activists from across the country would have nominated Moyers by acclamation when he finished a remarkable address in which he challenged not just the policies of the Bush Administration but the failures of Democratic leaders in Congress to effectively challenge the president and his minions. In the face of what he described as 'a radical assault' on American values by those who seek to redistribute wealth upward from the many to a wealthy few, Moyers said he could not understand 'why the Democrats are afraid to be labeled class warriors in a war the other side started and is winning.'   Several of the Democratic presidential contenders who addressed the crowd after Moyers picked up pieces of his argument. Former US Senator Carol Moseley Braun actually quoted William Jennings Bryan, while North Carolina Senator John Edwards and Massachusetts Senator John Kerry tried -- with about as much success as Al Gore in 2000 -- to sound populist. Former House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt promised not to be 'Bush-lite,' and former Vermont Governor Howard Dean drew warm applause when he said the way for Democrats to get elected 'is not to be like Republicans, but to stand up against them and fight.' Ultimately, however, only the Rev. Al Sharpton and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Dennis Kucinich came close to matching the fury and the passion of the crowd.   Kucinich, who earned nine standing ovations for his antiwar and anti-corporate free trade rhetoric, probably did more to advance his candidacy than any of the other contenders. But he never got to the place Moyers reached with a speech that legal scholar Jamie Raskin described as one of the most 'amazing and spellbinding' addresses he had ever heard. Author and activist Frances Moore Lappe said she was close to tears as she thanked Moyers for providing precisely the mixture of perspective and hope that progressives need as they prepare to challenge the right in 2004.   That, Moyers explained, was the point of his address, which reflected on White House political czar Karl Rove's oft-stated admiration for Mark Hanna, the Ohio political boss who managed the campaigns and the presidency of conservative Republican William McKinley. It was McKinley who beat Bryan in 1896 and -- with Hanna's help -- fashioned a White House that served the interests of the corporate trusts.   Comparing the excesses of Hanna and Rove, and McKinley and Bush, Moyers said 'the social dislocations and the meanness of the 19th century ' were being renewed by a new generation of politicians who, like their predecessors, seek to strangle the spirit of the American revolution 'in the hard grip of the ruling class.'   To break that grip, Moyers said, progressives of today must learn from the revolutionaries and reformers of old. Recalling the progressive movement that rose up in the first years of the 20th century to 'restore the balance between wealth and commonwealth,' and the successes of the New Dealers who turned progressive ideals into national policy, Moyers told the crowd to 'get back in the fight.' 'Hear me!' he cried. 'Allow yourself the conceit to believe that the flame of democracy will never go out as long as there is one candle in your hand.'

"                 What a day.   Apparently I'm good at helping people.   I'm a bit bored of it.  OK, not completely. But there's so much of it. People being hospitalized. People getting separated. People being afraid. Everyone needs petting. And hand holding. And some of them deserve it and need it. Most of them? Do not. Making me completely crazy.  I guess I'm very lucky. I know that if I ever needed anything like a place to stay or a ride to the hospital or a thousand dollars to keep me and my baby alive (my fictional baby) I'd have more than one place to turn. And I'd probably have more than one person who could look at this situation and figure out how to make it better, how to make the worst not necessary. It turns out that most people don't have that. How is that possible?  But anyway, I'm home now. I can do stuff for my life and I don't have a mother and toddler living with me and no one is homeless or injured or dead.

"             Ug.  Boring Saturday.  Party and the park is going on, we only went up for a bit.  I hate it, the minute someone I know sees me they come up and want to ‘chat’.  GAH!  I don’t want to chat with people from Vinton!  Ah well.  We might go up to the parade later, I will probably go just to make the folks and Emily happy.  Blah.  We finished ‘Aliens’ and watched ‘Alien3’ last night.  How fun.    I’m not trying to be this dull, I just feel blah.  I want a job, classes, a project, something!  I would even love to just paint my room!  Gah!  I wish we could move.  Dad always talks about moving to Germany, and lately even more often.  I would love it.  But I guess it doesn’t really matter where they move, I ‘m getting older and will have my own chance to pick where I want to live.  Still, it would be nice to be near them, I realize how close we are, and I know it would be tough if I just up and vanished out of their lives.  It’d be hard for me as well.

This one is a very short one.    I was talking to my colleague on the way back home and there was a huge argument between us as whether life is destined to be the way it is or whether we have any say in this.     When we make a decision is it that we are destined to take that decision or is it really us making the decision? Is everything decided for us when we were born or does life take twists and turns based on our decisions?     I am of the opinion that my life was already decided and I am just walking along the path we have chosen. But then again I get this doubt. If my life is decided long before why are there this feelings of hate, anger, betrayal, etc. in my life. This also contradicts the theory of rebirth, which is actually caused by our bad deeds in our current life.    So any takers to help me on this question?

"             Booknotes: Stories from American History edited by Bryan Lamb Perseus Books  2001  One of the more creative results of corporate brainstorming is C-Span, the public affairs programming that now occupies three different channels on cable television. While the congressional hearings and gavel-to-gavel coverage of the United States Senate and House of Representatives are familiar to many, C-Span, under the leadership of the visionary Bryan Lamb, has branched out to provide educational programming, including an on-the-road educational touring bus program. In 1989, C-Span, with Lamb hosting, began to offer a series of interviews on non-fiction books. As Lamb tells it, the Booknotes series began as the result of a conversation with the late Warren Burger, the mediocre, pedantic, and unoriginal Chief Justice who found his calling as an administrator and later as the leader of the efforts to celebrate the bicentennial of the United States constitution.  Booknotes invites authors of non-fiction works to the spartan studio for one interview even if, as Lamb writes, 'we didn't have the foresight to book them for their masterwork.' The program is an often thought-provoking hour of insight into the creative process of writing and, of course, the substance of the book.   In 'Booknotes: Stories from American History', Lamb adapts these hour-long interviews into excerpted essays. Beginning with the revolutionary activities of the 1770s through the Reagan years in the 1980s, this book provides a broad tapestry of essays on books that cover the gamut of American history and American cultural, political, and social development. The survey, however, loses something in the excerpting. These interviews range rather freely and don't lend themselves well to editing. To cite one example, Lamb summarizes his interview with Elizabeth Taylor, author of the book 'American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley, his battle for Chicago and the Nation' with the following quotes:   Referring to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, he quotes Taylor as saying, '...in the end Daley was really underestimated, and he came out of it all brilliantly.' I've read 'American Pharaoh' and Elizabeth Taylor did NOT treat the 1968 Democratic convention as a highpoint for the dictatorial, racist mayor. It was a low point that marked his effective end as a national political powerbroker. He hardly 'came out of it brilliantly'. He was scorned and a United States senator attacked his police and city at the podium.   The excerpted interview seems less a reflection of the book written by Taylor than perhaps an effort to laud a political hero of Bryan Lamb's, if Daley is such. The excerpt barely touches on the corruption, the racism, and political blackmail that characterized Mayor Daley's 21 years in office, elements that are critical to the actual book Taylor produced.   This example demonstrates the weakness of the book. These essays are summarized and, in some cases, severely edited versions of free-ranging discussions on major works, most of which took years to research, write, and publish. As a survey of subjects in American history and a possible bibliography of works for someone interested in reading the works cited, it has a certain utility. As a summary, however, of the works, it is of fairly limited value and, as the Taylor interview shows, open to a rather profoundly inaccurate summarization.         ",male
"           Hello hello hello again. It's lovely to speak to you all. Really. Let's see... seeing as my mother is off at work for another 40 million hours and I have neither A) a license or B) a car (though I have a permit and could easily drive anywhere I wanted to had I my Jeep), I am inherently under house arrest.  'Oh,' you say, 'But it's such a lovely day outside! Why don't you take the dog for a walk, or go for a bike ride, or read a book in the sun?' Well, first off, I will not be taking anyone for a walk because I am just now regaining said gift of movement back myself. Yes, I have begun training for cross country, and it  hurts . Secondly, my dog is quite content to nap, and continue on in a napping way until about 6 o'clock when he will undoubtedly begin to go mad with hunger. Yes, I starve my dog. He never eats. He is bone thin, and can barely survive on the bits and scraps from the garbage left over from the feast last night.  Actually, he is getting rather portly.  We feed him the same two meals a day, it's just that he hasn't gone for any walkies in a bit. I should go throw the ball for him outside. But not now, he's napping. And besides, that much physical exertion after a long and strenuous day of, err, doing stuff, might just kill me. And I have practice tomorrow. Need to preserve my energy, I do. Of course, the scheduled practice was to go swimming. Well, coach calls it swimming, it's really treading water for forty minutes. But it  is  much more fun than drills and sprints, or even a long run. No, though. We can't go swimming. The swimmers are going swimming. Wait a bit, it's not even the swim team. It's... the children! Little children who are afraid of the water and cling to their mother's legs before getting thrown into their cold, wet, doom, only to be met by some overly-perky girl with a long blonde ponytail, enthusiastically encouraging the little kids who are innocently flailing their arms about to 'relax... be one with the water... and blow little bubbles... and...' So, while some children will become forever aqua-phobic, I and my fellow cross country runners will succumb to the pain and torture that is... the DP weight room. Again, actually not as bad as some workouts. It's just that, well, we did it on Tuesday. And it hurt. A lot. And it smells. A lot. And swimming is just way more fun. Ah well. C'est la vie.  Friday's workout is going to kill me. Sprints. I hate sprints. Sprints are the reason (besides wanting to devote my precious time to the beautiful art that is theatre) I quit track. And not only are we doing sprints, oh no, we are doing sprints  on the BEACH!  Ooh, it just keeps getting better. (Dear reader, you must know that, while I do seem rather sarcastic and cynical, I really do love cross country. Besides the pain, it's a fantastically fab group of people. It's just that it's very easy to complain about. Not that anyone reads this... but I digress). Yes, so, anyway... ah yes. And, on Saturday, whilst everyone is dragging themselves up Gaviota Peak, I, in my Jeep, will be happily driving around in Los Angeles, shopping for back-to-school supplies, writing (in Italian) to  Sig. Cicale  back in Prague (or are they in Italy now?), and maybe taking in a nice leisurely bike ride around the lake.  Oh, and shopping for something to give to Ariel for her grand birthday spectacular that I know she will have in a few weeks. I feel like an old lady around all my DP frieds. Well, all my freshman friends anyway. I was just at Karisa's for her 15th birthday, and Whitney hit 15 in March, Ariel will be on the 16th of August, and Molly - not until January  of next year!  However,  I  shall be happily celebrating my Sweet 16 come November.  A round of huzzahs!, if you will. Well, I suppose I must be going now. I've loads of important people to see and many things that need tending to. Perhaps we shall chat again sometime soon? Baci, ~K         ",female

I am happy because last time, I had bad marks, and for this time, because I want to go and wait for him to leave his works, so I just use 1 day to finish this assignment, then go out to play for 2 days. For those I handed out on time, I got 1 bonus mark because the lecturer had extended the due date, so who handed out on time can have 1 bonus mark.   Last night, I had a nice dream with Gavin and Tim about while we are driving on the road, a police talked with them in Meridian, then I needed to translate to them, but while I am translating, I spoke Cantonese, then they laugh out loudly :-( then I spoke in English again to them. At that time, I also had woke up and laugh for a while!  Tonight, I should have a good sleep and waiting for tomorrow coming. :-)  好緊張呀，快點兒到明天啦。因為明天係我第一次同自己個男朋友去旅行，以前都只係同前度男朋友去過一日的旅行吧了。希望有一個愉快的旅程。  今天，第二份的測量功課有結果，合格呀。現在係澳洲讀書，合格就已經好開心的呀﹗今次我只好了一天的時間便做完這份功課，因為為了同Gavin去街，哈哈。但係亦都有好處，因為教授推遲了交功課的時間，但是如果準時交的話便可以有加1分。無情情加了1分，真開心，可以用來補返上次欠的1分。  昨晚，我發了一個有關Gavin同Tim的夢，係有關我們在路上駕車，忽然有一警察同我們講話，他是說普通話的，跟著我便翻譯給Gavin同Tim知，但我不知不覺地用廣東話同他們講，他們便忍不住大笑 :-( (我便連忙用英文再翻譯多一次。而且在那一刻，我驚醒過來，還坐在床上笑了出來，我也覺得自己百痴。但之後就好好訓，等待著明天的來臨。 :-)          ",female

"                  A is for… Ate: this is what I am—to my akong TJ, to my shobe Terenggoy, and to my pinsans whom I dearly love.   Akong:  A is for Akong. Akong is what we call my brother TJ. That’s a Chinese pet name for little boys. He is one of the pinakamakulit little boys I have ever known. When we were kids, I and my play mates always tried to avoid letting TJ know what we were up to because surely, he would just turn everything into a disaster! He’s maligalig. Couldn’t keep himself from toppling down things, our Nanay’s figurines, heck, he couldn’t even behave and try not hurt himself. He would always tease my friends and would always insist on being the policeman or the daddy when in fact, we were playing school-school!  When we grew up, he remained makulit and pestered our bunso, Tere. Yet Akong is one of the most wonderful men the world fortunately has.   Antukin:  I have been known to have the ability to sleep whenever, wherever. I once fell asleep while sitting on the foot of a staircase in a friend’s house. I fell asleep for probably two seconds while biting on a lanzones (which I was eating to keep me awake during a training seminar); fell asleep while taking pictures in an interview job…    B is for…    Brilliant:  my mind is brilliant—or so I’d like to belive. Hehe.   Betchay:  my mom’s close friends call her Betchay. Her full name though is Elizabeth Leonila. All my friends think Betchay is the coolest mom a girl could have. Of course, we’ve had fights but Mama is one-of-a-kind. She is perhaps the strongest woman I know. When Papa left us, she wept, mourned for a love lost, grieved for her children who lost a father, then pulled herself together and went on living…  To this day, Mama is now happy with a man who loves her, Big Kuya.    C is for…      Crush :  I had my first one when I was eleven. His name was Arjayson and I didn’t even know that was “it”.  I always looked forward to spending summer vacation at my grandparents’ farm in Bulacan because Arjayson lived in one of the my family’s apartments. He would climb aratiles trees and would always tease me I couldn’t climb a tree because I was a girl. He was my crush, my first crush though.  And isn’t it nice to have crushes from time to time? : )    Chips Ahoy !:  My favorite is Chips Ahoy! Chewy and Stripes. I don’t see these in the supermarkets nowadays but I remember the first time I laid my eyes on a big blue Chips Ahoy pack: I was all gluttonous and didn’t want to share the cookies with anyone. I kept them in my backpack, forgot about it and the Mickey Mice in the house ate `em up—including my bag (bored holes).    Chinoy :  A lot of people ask me “are you Chinese”? whenever they hear my surname. Yes and no. Yes because my Lolo Julio came from Macao and my Lola Mommy is from Shanghai, only that her mother was a Cebuana. My maternal grandparents has 50% Chinese lineage too. And no, I’m not Chinese because 1) I don’t use chopsticks 2) I have a fear of seeing Chinese Opera live 3) I cant count 1-10 in Mandarin or Fukkien 4) because I am simply not.               ",female
"        urlLink Bad Checks Spell Trouble For Forger   'AUGUST 5--Meet Fitzhugh Fenderson, an alleged felon in dire need of a spell checker. The 33-year-old Long Island man is facing grand larceny and forgery charges for a scheme to swindle car dealerships out of pricey SUVs. According to cops, Fenderson last month passed bogus certified checks at two Cadillac dealerships, walking away with a pair of $65,000 Escalades. When the checks bounced, the dealers ran to Nassau County cops, who yesterday nabbed Fenderson, who was at the wheel of one of the Cadillacs when placed in cuffs. However, had the car salesmen looked more closely at Fenderson's checks they would have realized there was a problem with the paper. Along with misspelling 'Roosevelt,' his own hometown, Fenderson had trouble correctly rendering 'Chase Manhattan Bank.' Below you'll find one of those bogus 65k checks, passed at a Freeport dealership last month. Perhaps the next time Fenderson goes auto shopping he'll leave the checks at home and pay with cash.'             ",male
"       My world is now; tomorrow doesn't exist for me.  Which doesn't say I live a hedonistic life. Quite the opposite. My world is now;  now  is what counts,  now  is when I can do the things I need to do. Tomorrow doesn't exist; tomorrow was never promised to anyone, and no one can claim tomorrow as theirs.  So I often find myself, against better judgment, attempting to do more things than what I can handle. Which is maladaptive.  Note to self: live life one day at a time. Be a little less demanding. Be a little less neurotic.  (...yeah, right...)  In the meantime, my world is now...and tomorrow...tomorrow doesn't exist for me.         ",male
"       OK Grandma has been sick.  Killy tells me that I have no empathy for people who are sick.  It's true, I'm sad to say.  Maybe it's because I am never sick.  Or at least, I refuse to be sick.  After listening to MamaLynda coughing all last week and watching her feebly surviving each day, I tried to understand why she was so knocked out by this.  It's really hard for me to imagine being knocked out by something that isn't causing my lungs to swell through my ribcage or my temperature to soar to obscene levels. I'm talking to my sister about illnesses right now.  I don't remember being sick as a little girl, but apparently she does.  She tells me that I would get sick VERY often.  My symptoms would include super high fevers and were always a dramatic event for the family as they would often sit by listening to me ranting feverishly through my turbulent nightmares. Maru tells me that she would sneak by the 'isolation' room where I would invariably be placed, and watch my mother praying over me, rubbing my naked body with alcohol and sloshing wet rags all over me to bring down my temperature.  She would yell to my mother that I was going crazy when my fevers would bring me to a new point of deliria.  She remembers looking at me during my feverish highs and wondering if I was asleep or awake as my eyes were half open and I would be screaming and mumbling deliriously. I asked her if I was mean and impatient with her whenever she got sick.  Maru says she never got sick.  But when she did, she said I would complain a lot because I had to do her housework.  Boy, I sure don't like myself in my sister's eyes. But then, Maru reveals to me, that she is the same!  She also recognizes that she has no patience for people who get sick. My brother says this...     Maru hardly got sick.  You got sick more.  When you got sick, you were like a little sickly bird.  You were so skinny.  And your baby hair on your forehead was always wet, like a little newborn bird.  Your eyes never shut all the way when you slept.  And your eye lids were so thin, like a newborn bird.  I remember always feeling scared seeing you sick.  But you were brave.  You always seemed to be in Carol-land instead of sick land.  As weak as you were, you were brave.    Especially that one Christmas Eve.  We were all waiting for midnight to open our gifts after church.  You were so sick.  But you fell asleep.  When midnight came, I ran to get you but all I saw as a sickly bird in a nest of coats and jackets on mom's bed.  I felt bad because you wanted to open the gifts so bad but you were sickly.   Maru, just ignored being sick altogether.  It's like she didn't even know she was sick.    When I get sick, I'm a big baby.  Thing is, I can be sick and I'm fine.  But, occassionally, I really, really get very sick.  When that does happen, I don't ask for things, I just make you feel guilty.  But now, nobody pays attention to me.  And, if anybody does do something for me, I don't feel it's enough.  So, I just deal with it myself.     Ironically, when others get sick, I think they are just making it worse than what it is.  I think they are just doing it for attention.  Except for Adi & Thalia, I just feel so helpless when they are sick and I spoil them.     So all of us have this wierd impatience with people who let their illness be on display, as if advertising for sympathy.  Maru tells me she thinks it's because of my parent's attitude when they were sick.  She says that they would just get up and go.  That there was too much to do to waste time being sick.  So with this in mind, many questions arise... Does this mean that I am sick each time I wake up with a sniffley nose? Does this mean I should stay home for an entire week nursing a little cough?  Hmmm...         ",female

"       It has been such a long day. I woke up and had to go to Stuart for the Area Council Car Wash. Great day for it, because it rained all day. So, therefore no one wanted their car washed, and the fact that only 1/5 the area council members showed up. We had so much fun tho, between me triend to figure out the McDonalds hose and all the girls whoring themselves on the corner tryin to get people to come to the carwash. Then these fuckin deuchebags showed up and said wash our car for a $1. So I, bein the smartass that I am told them they could get a little spray and maybe a lil soap so they flipped out and it was rather funny actually.

After that i did chores. then watched the Belmont Stakes to see if Smarty Jones could win the Triple Crown. He didnt he lost to Birdstone.

"       Tonight was my second ever Ashtanga class, and 50 minutes after the end of the class, I'm still kinda shaky.   Class was a bit difficult. I was sick yesterday, a bit tired today, not feeling too in shape tonight, but I went to class anyways because I always come out of there feeling awesome. And, of course, I do feel awesome now.  We had a semi-private class: only 4 other students showed up! So the teacher was able to spend a lot more time on each of us, and that's always great... although a bit depressing when you think you're doing a pose right, and she comes and adjusts you, and you feel the difference in your muscles, and you go 'Riiiiight.  That's  what it should feel like!'. Ok, depressing isn't the right word. But you know what I mean. You're all proud because you think you're doing this pose especially well, then you find out you're all wrong. Kinda bursts your bubble, doesn't it? But hey, I'm in class to learn, and so I'm learning and enjoying it a lot!  We practiced  urlLink Salamba Sarvangasana , a particularly difficult one for me. But then I realized that,  this one , I'm not doing so back. Of course, there's an angle between my body and my legs, as straightening that part of my body is the most difficult (also in  urlLink Setu Bandha Sarvangasana , and having my face that close to my chest really makes me see the curve in my spine (from the scoliosis) and of course that's not something I like to have my face rubbed in (literally!), but at least I'm not doing it so bad and that's good!  Class with Cynthia was fantastic, as usual, and she's one of those teachers who likes to adjust students a lot, and I benefit immensely from that.   So there, Ashtanga exhausts me, but I'm loving it!         ",female

"       i had a dream where i was happy.   that is not to say that i am not happy now. in this dream, i was complete.   it was a dream of a day, a day in the future, a day i hope for often. it was just a day. i woke up in a bed of soft sheets and warm arms.  his arms . the alarm was making the most annoying sound from my cell phone and i lazily reached over to turn it off, with a grumble. i murmured something to the person i was sharing the bed with and we got up slowly, with the typical scratches, yawns and comments about 'decent hours of the morning'. the shower was started, the coffee was made and we were eating breakfast, discussing our day as we ran around with egg sandwiches in our mouths, gathing up the briefcases and work tools. the conversation carries over into the car, a mention of a weird dream and off i go, with a swig of coffee before the lingering goodbye kiss, into work.   there are a few emails, both ranting about some issue and then he shows up at exactly the same time he always does. we greet each other with the warmest kiss. we both look forward to this time with each other away from the phones and voices and stresses. we go to the same coffee shop we always go to, make the same jokes about getting the exact same things all the time and have the same wonderful lunch we always do. yes, there were little struggles, but overcoming them brings the joy.   again, both back at work and understanding the particular stress of the day, we send and email or two to help each other get through the day - a reference to a private joke, something mocking a current of stress or any little gesture to show care and concern.   at the end of the day, he greets me at my office, reading or working, as i finish up the day. finally done, he can greet me proper and we head off home, after a quick trip to the grocery store to buy the dinner supplies. the evening is mundane. cooking and talking, watching tv and working, kisses here and there, cuddlies and snugglies at the perfect moments. nothing amazing, but everything perfect. the normal discussion of life obligations and plans we both have made are discussed and sorted out so everything fits. we both rearrange, we both compromise because we understand what is important to the other person.   simple, but perfect.   the rest of the night is something that i will keep to myself, but it was amazing.   the whole dream had a feel of being 'everyday', ordinary. that we lived this perfect way, yes with problems, but perfect because we sorted them out. we both took the responsibility and no one was left feeling over-worked or under-appreciated. we understood how each other 'is', so the little annoyances or possible 'problems' are simply let go if, because that is who we 'are'.   i don't need money. i don't need fame. i need that. i need the passion for life, the passion for happiness, the passion for each other.

"       Royal Oak's best just left moments ago...  I heard someone walking behind my apartment window. The sound of what I heard was too heavy a foot to be any sort of wild animal. I'm convinced.  The policemen that arrived did a thorough search, and found no one in the vicinity. Thankfully so. I asked the officers if they saw any footprints in back. I was told that they saw a lot of cut weeds back there. My landlord just cut down all the brush and weeds behind my apartment...which would make most things difficult to see at this time of night.  I get nervous about these things. I had a 'Peeping Tom' attempt to watch me when I was in the shower a few years back. I had a good idea of who it was, a handyman that my landlord had hired to do some work around the apartments. An officer came to the apartment, saw footprints where the window for my shower is, and 'spoke' to the man in question. I didn't have a problem after that.  Did you know that it has been said 1 in 13 women will be stalked in their lifetime? I am in those statistics...which is another reason I am very cautious. Been there, done that, and could have written a book.  I've thought about having something on hand in my apartment for personal protection. I respect other's rights to own a gun. I do not want one in my apartment. I'd rather have a stun gun, a non-lethal way to take an attacker down. In the state of Michigan, it is illegal for anyone but law enforcement to possess them. I'm thinking about seeing what it would take to introduce an initiative that would make them legal in Michigan.  I know I'm rambling a bit.  Let me blame that on the hour at which I am writing this.  I am heading back to bed, and will see about having a motion detector light installed sometime this week.  If my landlord won't pay for it...I will.  I'm a firm believer in the saying, 'Better safe than sorry...'  ~ Michelle   'Quemadmodum gladius neminem occidit, occidentis telum est.'

It's grey and black and silver.  Mui Catolico.  I dig it.  Its right below the pickup on the Ibanez now.  Virgen Maria is very latina looking.  dark hair and eyes.  I love it.  I'll have to get more.  the restaraunt i got it from is the best Mexican food place in town (and believe me, i've LOOKED) and a really swell lady runs it.  She gets Norteno and Pop bands to come up and play in the community center.  she was telling me she was trying to get a larger venue, so i told her about the new performing arts center at the college.  Better to have bands there anyway, since the sound at NBMC sucks SO DAMN BAD.  (nothing like sitting in a wood rectangle that just bounces the soundwaves all over the place, rendering it all as MUD.) I've seen some great bands in there, bands i know rock in a different place, but the stupid center just has the WORST acoustics.  Good for actual acoustic gigs, or vocal performances, but get amps and stuff in there and it's just shitty for anyone.     ",female

We went shopping Saturday so I could find some more hoochie-mama clothes- I got a new barbell with a french tickler on top *waggles her eyebrows* not that anybody's really gonna ever y'know.... We went shoppin Sunday for new bathing suits- I found a lime green and blue one that matches my barbell perfect. Um, we went to the lake Sunday too. but Saturday? My friend Dan finally came out to the bar and sure enough... dickhead Scott had to be a bitch. He flicked ashes on him (I hope it was an accident, but i'm almost sure it wasnt) was threatenin to beat him up, just bein plain wrong to him for no reason. It was pissin me off, so I got me a shot of tequila, went over and asked if I could punch him, and punched him for all the things he'd done. He said it didnt hurt, so he got slapped a couple times too. Told me I was violent Sunday morning. Sunday, we went to Jans, and of course Dan came out 'cause that's his bar that he hangs out at. My Monya friend met a new one and he's awesome. I really hope things work out... We all went to Angelo's where I had to get beat up by Dan :P just playin. Rae's boyfriend busted her eye open and so I got a phone call at about 3 from her letting me know- she got 11 stitches in her eye. Douglas Queen, you are sooo in trouble. He told me it was my responsibility when he beat her ass, well I guess that makes it my job to take care of him for putting his hands on her too, right? Well, yesterday was Monday. I told Lori I need someone to play cupid for me and she told me the guy for me was right in front of my face... talking about Dan.

Then I went for a shower and then ate lunch. Matt called me then and we 3-wayed with Ashwin we decided on something but I forgot. I went on the computer for a little while. I talked to Liz and Sam. Then I left to go to Ashwin's. As I was leaving, they were right there. We went inside to see if Sam was online. In that time Ashwin and Matt wanted to talk to Jigar. He was talking to my mom. We went upstairs and asked Sam if he could do anything but he said he was going to his dad's Frullati. We went downstairs and talked to Jigar briefly. He made fun of them in Gujarati and I laughed.

Ashwin flicked me off during the course of the time. LOL. Oh well. They got mad and Ashwin just left. We cleaned up and looked if Ashwin was still upstairs. He wasn't. We rode around. We dropped by Michael Liu's to pick up our money he owed us. He gave me my dime. He's still a dime short. Matt didn't get his money because he didn't have change. Then we went back to my house got drinks, and then went on the computer for about an hour. We talked to Anna about stuff. We also talked to Ashwin. Matt kept scaring me pretending to be a murderer. We also talked to Michelle W. on the phone. It was funny. Matt tried to get some information out of her. We talked to Rajiv. He uses proper punctuation. I find that quite silly actually. I called him a 'gangsta'. LOL. After all this, we left and went riding around. We rode around half of Grosse Pointe. As we were riding up Ashwin's street, he came outside. Matt told Ashwin about my 'minority' paranoia. LOL. We rode around in the same places as me and Matt rode around. We were really close to Nicole's house then we turned around and went to Marissa's because Ashwin wanted to. We went there and did nothing really. We just talked about things. Nick came and we talked to him a bit. Then we all went to Nicole's house. *Sigh* Sweet, sweet Nicole. LOL. Anyways we talked to her. She showed us her Great Uncle's football cards. He used to play on the San Fancisco 49ers. We also insulted George W. Bush a lot. Marissa got really mad. LOL. We called Ben and annoyed him but he kept hanging up. LOL. We got called by Michelle W. LOL. She also kept hanging up. I talked to her for a while. Then my dad called and I went home. I talked to her on my way home. LOL. Anyways I got home and ate. Then I left and looked for someone to hang out with. I found Ashwin at Emily's. I got a freezie-freeze and then we left. We played 21 at Ashwin's. Ashwin won and then we went to the park.

When two people have shared as much as you and I have, when they've opened up their hearts, shared their dreams, thoughts, and fears.  We have come to know each other well enough to know if sadness is hiding behind a smile or if happiness is glowing from the others eyes. We have shared so many laughs,  and we know when each others pain at times has triggered some tears.  We have come to believe in one another and are always sincere to the other,  we have trusted one another with the truth that lies within our hearts. Our true love has yet to be seen with the eyes,  but it's felt with our hearts, we have gained trust, understanding, secrets, loyalty, and sharing ones deepest passions.  This love is rarely found in life, but when it's found it has a profound impact on one's well being, strength and character.  A true love does not need elaborate gifts or spectacular events in order to be valuable or valued.  True love needs what I have to give to you now.

"       Me again.  (Well duh, who else would it be?)  It's been an uneventful day.  We had a few formations, I waited in line 3 hours for a drug test, shined my boots, started a letter, got really frustrated with my mom when her cell phone kept breaking up as she was driving through the mountains (though I know it's not her fault).  Then I swept the floor and found out that my morning cleaning duty is cleaning the washing machines.  Exciting.  So, anyway.  You know the question 'If a tree falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?'.....  Well, my question is similar.  'If a girl writes a blog, and no one bothers to read it, does she exist?'  Not really parallel, but close.  Just think.  And if you are reading, e-mail me!         ",female

"           Argh eating lunch now, after nearly breaking my arm on this fucking chair. Ah but coffee tastes good. I won't bore you with the details but me and CB are having a crisis, a sexual crisis, as in it's very possible that I could be pregnant but we just can't shake off the feeling that the man is infertile so we don't know. Tonight I shall have a conversation with Beenie she is the expert on these matters, well on the morning after pill matter, anyways. I hate this fucking chair, it threw me off good and proper and I spilt a bit of coffee and dropped my first cheese/apricot jam sandwich onto the floor which nearly made me cry because I had taken a bite and it was so good...so I had to throw it out, I had to mop up the coffee and I had to rub my bruised arm. I mean, really why did it happen? Am I pregnant?  No, really. Am I?  Sorry I thought Paranoid humour would work...but somehow it just makes me feel worse. Sex was good though but it's ALWAYS good, I mean it's like..you have a guranteed great fuck. Ho-Hum. No really, it's more than that somehow, the whole 'Love' thing makes it exciting each time. But god dammit did we have to not use a rubber? did he HAVE to...you know...oh fuck... let's see... I watched Down With Love Saturday night, and it sucked, heh, I just don't want to sound smug you see...But the film really was not...good. I mean Ewan was great to watch and so was Renee, whom you know I don't really mind....except I did mind her at the end of this film because I wanted to shoot her and the screenwriters for putting me through that fucked up ending that made no sense. I think Been put it best when she very loudly said 'What?' during the so called climax of the flick. The crowd laughed more at what she said than the film itself. If Been's succint exclamation makes no sense listen to what Peter Traves from Rolling Stone said about it: 'What starts as freshly spun cotton candy ends as something pink, sticky and indigestible. You leave the theater wanting to puke it up.' Amen, bro.  Did I mention Renee is going to play Janis Joplin? Ha. Fuck you Hollywood.   Listening to:  'And I know...

"             Well, my plan with Brian was to start a conversation that would get his mind thinking about our relationship and how being monogamous with me might not be a bad experiment to undergo.  Then, he cancelled on me.  Again.  Around noon yesterday.  And I was pissed.  I had been mentally prepared to talk to him.  I'd finally grown the balls I needed to say the things I've been thinking about for so long, to share the things that have been keeping me up nights and tormenting me in my solitude (yes, it's a morning for dramatic flare).  And he cancelled on me.  So, instead of doing this face to face, I sent him a really long email telling him what I have been thinking about.  I didn't want to do it that way, but once I started writing and felt the release of actually saying what I've been biting back for so long, I couldn't stop.  I knew that this was the time that this had to happen.  I love him.  If I didn't love him, I wouldn't care.  If I didn't think this would improve the quality of both our lives, I wouldn't have said anything in the first place.  It was time to take a risk.  If I lose him, well, at least I tried.  So I woke up at 6 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep.  My nerves are wrecked right now.  I stayed in bed until 6:45 when my second alarm went off and then got out of bed and got ready for work.  I was here at 10 til 8. I even made coffee for the guys, though I don't know how good it really is.  Jake said it is ok, but he might have been saving my feelings.  You never know.  If you have any positive energy to send my way, please do.  I'm collecting it all in a bucket in my head.  I think I have just about everyone covered.  People are praying to different gods, we are all pooling this energy.  It's going to thunder storm today.  It's November and we had a thunder storm last night.  Natty and I have been talking about weird energy that seems to be all around us right now.  It's been building up for a while, now, and it just feels like change is in the air.  I've had lots of positive signs about Brian and me being together.  I have to trust in the universe.  I need all the help I can get.  It may not end how I want it to, but at least this will all be resolved one way or the other.  Maybe not today, but hopefully soon.  And we'll just keep everything crossed that this is the one thing in my life I'm guessing right about.   I'm sorry to be so self-absorbed right now, but I can't help it.  At least I'm fairly calm today.  Yesterday I was practically chewing through my desk.  If you don't take chances, you never get anywhere, right?  If you don't risk losing everything, or at least things that are important to you, you can never gain anything of worth.  It'll all be ok in the end.  It'll work out like it's supposed to.  Who am I trying to convince here?  Me or the universe? :)          ",female

"                  Six days...  until St. Philip's Day !   Philip's Purity  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  'Philip well knowing the pleasure which God takes in cleanness of heart, had no sooner come to years of discretion, and to the power of distinguishing between good and evil, than he set himself to wage war against the evils and suggestions of his enemy, and never rested till he had gained the victory. Thus, notwithstanding he lived in the world when young, and met with all kinds of persons, he preserved his virginity spotless in those dangerous years of his life.  No word was ever heard from his lips which would offend the most severe modesty, and in his dress, his carriage, and countenance, he manifested the same beautiful virtue.  One day, while he was yet a layman, some profligate persons impudently tempted him to commit sin. When he saw that flight was impossible, he began to speak to them of the hideousness of sin and the awful presence of God. This he did with such manifest distress, such earnestness, and such fervour,that his words pierced their abandoned hearts as a sword, and not only persuaded them to give up their horrible thought, but even reclaimed them from their evil ways.  At another time some bad men, who are accustomed to think no one better than themselves, invited him on some pretext into their house, under the belief that he was not what the world took him to be; and then, having got possession of him, thrust him into a great temptation. Philip, in this strait, finding the doors locked, knelt down and began to pray to God with such astonishing fervour and heartfelt heavenly eloquence, that the two poor wretches who were in the room did not dare to speak to him, and at last themselves left him and gave him a way to escape.  His virginal purity shone out of his countenance. His eyes were so clear and bright, even to the last years of his life, that no painter ever succeeded in giving the expression of them, and it was not easy for anyone to keep looking on him for any length of time, for he dazzled them like an Angel of Paradise.  Moreover, his body, even in his old age, emitted a fragrance which, even in his decrepit old age, refreshed those who came near him; and many said that they felt devotion infused into them by the mere smell of his hands.  As to the opposite vice. The ill odour of it was not to the Saint a mere figure of speech, but a reality, so that he could detect those whose souls were blackened by it; and he used to say that it was so horrible that nothing in the world could equal it, nothing, in short, but the Evil Spirit himself. Before his penitents began their confession he sometimes said, 'O my son, I know your sins already.'  Many confessed that they were at once delivered from temptations by his merely laying his hands on their heads. The very mention of his name had a power of shielding from Satan those who were assailed by his fiery darts.  He exhorted men never to trust themselves, whatever experience they might have of themselves, or however long their habits of virtue.  He used to say that humility was the true guard of chastity; and that not to have pity for another in such cases was a forerunner of a speedy fall in ourselves; and that when he found a man censorious, and secure of himself, and without fear, he gave him up for lost.   Prayer  Philip, my glorious Patron, who didst ever keep unsullied the white lily of thy purity, with such jealous care that the majesty of this fair virtue beamed from thine eyes, shone in thy hands, and was fragrant in thy breath, obtain for me that gift from the Holy Ghost, that neither the words nor the example of sinners may ever make any impression on my soul. And, since it is by avoiding occasions of sin, by prayer, by keeping myself employed, and by the frequent use of the Sacraments that my dread enemy must be subdued, gain for me the grace to persevere in these necessary observances.'

"       there is positively too much porn  on the net..  thats like the understatement of the year. well since we do exercise a degree of control over what and where we go online. its a matter of exercising our choice. if u don't like porn don't go look for it. don't be all searching for it and then say there's too much porn and suggest 'lets all ban the internet'.  anyways what got me started about this whole thing was when i was watching NTV 7 rejigged news program. the main headline was how young girls are being mislead on the internet. of how older men posing as younger guys are setting up dates with these girls and are taking advantage of the whole thing. the reporter than proceded to demonstrate how easy it was for girls to be approached by this men asking for sexual favors. i was thinking, wait a minute, that's not how it goes.        One of the many spots..      the thing is, the reporter went to a sex or 'adult' chat room. u go to these rooms not to find company or someone to talk to. u go there because ur horny little mind wants to go there so u can work out ur issues or what not. but the report portrayed it as if if u go on IRC nowadays ur susceptible to be approached by random strangers with offers of random sex. thats not right. it is true that while the IRC/chat/IMs and all that has become a popular medium for paedophiles to do their thing but it still has certain element of user control.  for example if i was approached by some stranger saying if i want to see his 12 inch schwang (virtual guide to schwang sizes is u minus 6' for actual size), clearly that is not my scene so i should just put the little bugger on ignore. seriously, if u go to these places/chatrooms and all that, u need to bear in mind that not everything is what it seems and u should exercise some common sense and control.   well, i think instead of the report showing how easy it was to be approched by sleazebuckets in a sex chat room. it should emphasize educating these possible victims on ways of detecting that ur online buddies are not who they say they are. here's some easy tips:  1) If the picture they send u has a striking resemblance to Allesandro Nesta than it probably is Allesandro Nesta - (have keena to thanks for this) anyone can send u any picture and claim it is them. if i put a pic of Brad Pit on me blog and say it was me.. would anyone buy it? hehe same with ircs, IM's and all the lot.. dont be so gullible.. 2) If they send u dirty emails/pics and all that - simply ignore and dont open them lest you might be tempted.. or even worse might also have viruses. u get them Bots in chat rooms posting links to websites with pics on it, the file name says jpg but cleverly hidden is jpg.exe with the exe in white colored font the same as ur background so u cant see it. probably a virus or some spyware installer. 3) NEVER i repeat NEVER agree to meet them alone.. well if u insist on it ALWAYS pick public places - in the first place i'll advice against physical meetings, but hey if u reaaly need to see that ur Brad Pit lookalike e-pal really looks like Homer Simpson than be my guest, but make sure safety is always first. 4) Well what else is there? i can't think of anything else at the moment.. 5) If ur one of those peeps who goes to sex chatrooms looking for sex, then same rules still applies, and the final word is NO still means NO. if u've set the date, but decides to change ur mind, it doesnt give the dude a reason to still go ahead and rape you. NO means NO, so guys DON'T! STOP' means STOP not Don't stop as in go on..  anyways, when we are online chatting, surfing and all that, we need to remember that there's a lot of crap going around and also there's loadsa useful stuff too. Don't be painting everything with the same brush eh. U know how i hate to generalize...    ",male

"                 Well ... today was one of the worst days of my life. Lets review it step-by-step...  1st: Form assembly. Well, I've already written about how crap I felt then. So all I need to say is a big thankyou to Ella and Anna for being nice, and looking out for me.  2nd: Web Authoring. I was lonely. I'm always lonely these days. I don't know if it was even worth choosing that subject - but I wouldn't be any better off in Nationalism: firstly because I wouldn't enjoy it, and secondly because Ella and Adèle and Ingrid etc. are better friends with each other than they are with me ... and then there's the whole thing about Rebecca, who hasn't spoken to me in ages.  3rd: French. I love French. It's one of my favourite subjects (I know - it's pretty pathetic). But today in French we were presenting our orals, and my CD wouldn't work. I put  so  much effort into it, and I was actually looking forward to presenting it. Off to a bad start already.  4th: Recess. Nothing bad really happened at recess, but nothing good happened either. Actually, one bad thing happened: I realised I had double English next. (No offense Ms Roberts).  5th: Double English. Firstly - she made me read a part in Romeo & Juliet, which was bad. And when I got to go to the library to find a book for wide reading and came back with 8 - I don't think she was extremely impressed. And then Julia, Emily, Bob & Pip were having reading competitions with me, and Julia asked Ms Roberts to d one, and she wasn't too impressed by the idea ... too scared that I would beat her, perhaps? (Or maybe she just wanted to express her hatred towards me by showing that she won't voluntarily participate in activities involving me ... but then  WHY  am I in her camp group? - This is what I find impossible to understand!!!).  6th: Maths. We got our probability tests back. Naturally I made 2 stupid mistakes, and I lost a mark on one thing I misunderstood - yet  4  marks were missing. What had I done wrong??? That was the question I asked Mrs Kettle. Well, apparantly I lost a mark because I filled out the table with percentages instead of decimals. Why was this wrong, I asked. Because there was a one in the corner, meaning they should all add up to one. But technically, don't percentages add up to one, too - 100% = 1 in percentages language. Plus - I was never taught that they had to be decimals, and it didn't say that they had to be decimals in the question! Well, I fought long and proud, but I couldn't convince her to give me my mark back. And then I worked out my grade: if she hadn't taken off the mark, then I would have got an A+ ... but I'm stuck with an A, because my teacher hates me. Then I left the classroom feeling extremely upset, and spoke to Ella, who said in her class (the top group, which is where I am meant to be, but technically I'm not smart enough for...) were given the mark even if they did percentages, because Mr Gowdy thought that was correct. That's discrimination!!! Just because I'm in the 2nd group, Mrs Kettle thinks she can treat me like dumb shit!!!  7th: Abba. Actually, Abba was okay. Just a shout out to Mrs Mason to say thanks for being so nice - she's such a great person - was very kind to me in my strange hysteria (the effects of a certain maths teacher on my brain. Happens often after maths tests). So, thank-you Mrs Mason, and sorry I'm such a crap student. My next texts assignment is due tomorrow, and I promise it will be in on time!!!  8th: People and Politics. Well, Mr K forgot to come - so the first 1/2 hour of the lesson was fine - I was talking to Emma and Zoe. But then when he turned up, finally, after Elise and Margeaux had to go fetch him, he decided to start a discussion on the free trade agreement - which doesn't actually concern us, because none of us are old enough to vote - and if we cared then we'd read about it in the newspaper. And the he told us about our first assignment - a research paper on a  HERO . Yeah, well, who is my hero??? Harriet Walker - well she's a fictional character, can't do her!!! Melinda, Chrissy or even Jo (from  Small Claims ) - all fictional!!! Then there's Freya, but she's an actress ... and people would probably make fun of me. But she is a great role model. I don't know!!!  9th: P.E. I had a *note* to excuse myself from participating, so I got to watch the class learn some footy skills. Football's too dangerous for me. I was almost killed about 3 times by stray balls, and all I was doing was sitting behind the table. Mr Oneill's so used to it now. He even said to me, 'Are you too tired from avoiding playing soccer yesterday?' (yeah - I had almst perfect sports uniform yesterday - everything except I wore my school jumper).  10th: Fazz. Well - I turned up at the bus stop, just after 1/4 to 4 - the agreed time, and he wasn't there. So I sorta hung around, but I felt a bit weird seeing as I don't even catch the bus, until Vinnie told me Fazz wasn't even at school today. So I felt really shit ... I was looking forward to seeing him all day, it was raining, and I needed a hug.  11th: Gloria Jeans. There was a tram coming that was heading into Camberwell, so I decided to see if I could catch Ella, Lizz and Annaliese at Gloria Jeans, because I didn't feel like going home, and they left school just after me, so I knew I could catch them. They reached the tram stop at about the same time I did, coincidentally. So I joined them. I didn't think Ella and Lizz would mind. But Annaliese did. She really didn't seem happy with my desperate need for support, and my tagging along to avoid being alone.  12th: At the station. It wasn't so bad, until we got to the station and Ella left. I started crying, because she was gone, and Annaliese and Lizz were talking. I tried to include myself in the conversation, and Lizz helped, but Annaliese seemed unwilling. I don't know what I ever did to her - I like Annaliese, but she really doesn't seem to like me ... (sighs).  So anyway, there's not much I can do at the moment, except find my phone, and hope that by some miracle Fazz has messaged me. And I'm gonna call Ella - her counselling skills are required immediately.  Oh yeah - we didn't end up having the French vocab quiz (thankfully) !!!       ",female

The 35-year-old actor, who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, was on a one-week tour of the east Mexican state of Veracruz.  According to Mexican newspaper Reforma, dozens of residents from villages throughout the state, one of the poorest in the country, asked Caviezel to heal the sick and perform other miracles as he passed through.  The actor, who is himself a strict Catholic, said: 'The belief of these people really moved me.  'It was a shock for me to see how they came up to me to ask for my help.

"                   On my Mind     It's only Tuesday, and I am already having a really shitty week.     Reminds me of...     'Imagine if every Thursday your shoes exploded if you tied them the usual way. This happens to us all the time with computers, and nobody thinks of complaining.' Jeff Raskin.   AS you can well imagine I was having computer troubles *shock* and stumbled upon this one. Oh, and Brian, thanks for the virus scan link, worked wonders!!!     Crap of the day     I spent the better part of yesterday morning calling around to registry offices and driver education facilities to be told essentially that I can't take my license yet without it costing a few thousand dollars or not till September. Let me explain. See, I was all gun-hoe about getting my license and yadda yadda yadda, well Mark thought It would be a good Idea to check with the insurance company If our Insurance would be jacked up to an absorbent amount of money. We were Informed that If I didn't complete a drivers education couse I wasn't even insurable with our current company... which Mark has works really hard at getting his premiums lowered for the past 6 years. Anyways, we ask If we can go through a different company, and call around only to find out that If we switched Marks rate would go up another 50 bucks a month, and I would end up paying almost 340 dollars in insurance because I don't have the drivers education course that is now required in Alberta. SOOOO, I call the driver education places in the area and find out that they don't offer courses until the high schools start up and then they wait until enough students want to take the course to fill the class. SO I have to wait until all the kiddies get their shit together ask mommy and daddy and then I can go learn how to turn on a signal light and change my own fucking oil. I was so impressed.... I almost killed someone today. I was talking to my mother-in-law though, and she has hooked me up with a number for another driving school in Bonnyville. It is out of the way, but hey, I will do it If It gives me my license.  &nbsp;  *sigh*... so in other more happy news, Kira did two things that I am totally proud of!! She is waving hello/good-bye now, and she figured out the shape blocks and putting them in the right holes!! She is a frickin genius I tell ya!! I was so proud, we have been working on these things the past two weeks and she totally gets it now. I am really happy that she did this before daycare too.. so I get to see It and be the one who taught her. She also learned something not so cute.. she bit me today. I gave her a smack on the bum (which is of course layer with diaper padding) which shocked her more than anything.. but I hope she doesn't become a biter... or I might have to resort to mean and nasty things, I have no idea what those things are, I just know It can be done!

"           I do believe Vitriol and myself have neglected this site, when it has a potential of greatness. I realised this when I had a conversation with Vitriol the other evening about 'Mind vs. Heart' conversation. Which would have been something great to discuss on here. I think thats the trouble, so many of conversations are spontanious and there for never make it to this site.  I am going to have to think about a solution to this dilema..   perhaps just posting transcripts of our conversations here might be the  solution.. so to start the ball rolling.. here is the above (edited only to protect others) 'Mind vs. Heart' conversation, enjoy:  J: i think its funny how the brain and the rest argue.. its a funny interesting thing.. J: we are very interesting creatures.. V:  Yes, yes it is. I'm not so sure it's often all that funny... perhaps in hindsight. But certainly interesting, i have not doubt.  J: well not funny 'ha ha' but funny 'weird' J: i think its amazing the things ppl will tolerate, and ignore, .. and how we become blind in particular situations J: the human brain V:  That is true. Although, I must admit, I never really found many of my feelings strange. I always knew what they meant, and why they were occurring. Perhaps that was why I could control them more easily. And you're right; the logic in us will often revile the very person our 'heart' adores because of how they behave or act. It seems a constant battle.  J: yeah never find them strange.. but its just something i was thinking about just now..  i think its what makes ppl do things they always thought them selves never capable of..  J: i dunno.. its mind vs. heart V:  A friend of mine has a theory; that there are 'head' people and there are 'heart' people. Some are somewhat in-between. Or, to be a little clearer, there are degrees and extremes of both. I, for example, would be a 'head' person, because my logical mind is dominant over my desire and passion. Passionate people, however, lose much of their ability to be logical, especially when their passion is particularly ignited.  V:  Hehe... I'm glad I got that in first. *smirk*  J: yes i'd definatly say that i'm probably a heart person.... well swaying more on that side anyway.. but your right, it tends to be only in the moment.. i'll push away the head part and ignore it..  gets me into trouble *laugh* J: though i think i've grown from that somewhat  V:  To me, 'head' people often seem a little colder, harsher, and selfish than 'heart' people. Although far less self-effacing in their tendencies, and a little more honest about their true intentions, because they intrinsically (logically) -know- what they are. Heart people, I think, find themselves in trouble and in pain because they lack control over the situation, but ironically that's because they've invested far more in it.  J: see i agree and dissagree.. or more to the point correct somthing on that commeny.. heart ppl (well myself anyway) know what they are too..  and in the moment we choose to either ignore the logic or go for the 'oh fuck it, i'll think about it later, and just enjoy the moment' heart choise.. J: hense why heart ppl tend to be racked with guilt and worry about the effects our choices have on ourselves and other ppl V:  Well that's something I've always suspected, actually. That perhaps 'head' and 'heart' people both know darn well what's going to happen, but 'head' people see themselves as being able to cooly assert themselves and make the 'right' decision, whereas 'heart' people tend to take a punt, or risk pain in order to experience the pleasure of the moment.  J: yeah.. heart ppl risk more for the chance that regardless of all the logical and most probbable reason that it won't turn out for the best.. that it just might turn out just wonderful V:  Yeah, but how often does that happen? That's my rationale. I reckon everyone begins as a 'heart' person, but only those who learn from their mistakes become 'head' people. *smirk*  J: i think thats somtimes the case.. J: but thats makes it sound like heart ppl regret there decisions.. J: i may look back on somthing and say.. 'ok maybe thay wasn't the best idea as it didn't go anywhere'.. but i don't regret it.. whats done is done.. hehe... and atleast i had fun in that moment.. a head person wouldn't have had the moment at all J: head ppl need a little heart or they won't ever take chances.. J: every relationship is a risk.. 'should i or shouldn't i ask for her phone number?'... shes is brilliant and beautful and amazing, and chances are wiill shoot me down.. logically she's tell me to rack off.. but what if.? V:  Sometimes 'heart' people do regret their decisions. Sometimes 'head' people regret them, too. Mainly because they've been a right-old prick * .  J: yeah.. *ahem* J: :) V:  That's also true... 'heart' people do tend to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, more often than 'head' people, because they're willing to accept the risk to get the reward.  V:  Hehe... yeah, I thought you'd like that one ** .  J: sorry, couldn't help it.. ***  J: but that also goes back to the whole blind thing.. heart ppl tend to be the ones that become blind..  J: though in that case it wasn't blindness it was nieveity ****  J: how ever you spell it J: ah well..  V:  It's like anything; there are advantages and disadvantages to both. Sometimes it's better to be a 'head' person, sometimes it's better to be a 'heart' person.  J: yeah and i think we do swing both ways..  V:  Yep. Like I said, there's degrees. And 'heart' people will, in some circumstances act like 'head' people, and vice versa. There's no overriding rule, but I think most people 'tend' toward one or the other.  J: i find that when i'm attracted to a more  'head' person... i tend to go all heart.. but when its another heart person.. i'm probably more 'head'.. as if i go heart too it could turn out really nasty V:  Well, that's right. Two 'head' people are going to be picky, methodical and cold toward one another. They'll be trying to second-guess and work out the other person's objective from day one. Two 'heart' people will abandon everything they own and desire for the chance to be together as often as possible, even if the whole thing breaks down in a few weeks.  J: well i found that i think its cos with the heart ppl who fall for me.. my head goes.. what if i don't fall for you as much as you fall for me.. thats not fair on you.. i cna't hurt you.. its strange V:  I know what you mean. It's as if you can see 'em coming a mile away, and think 'shit, I'll have to be nice and open with this person because if I'm not, they're liable to get hurt, because they're all heart'. Which might also infer that they have no trouble abandoning everything to make your life hell for a while, also.  J: yeah.. J: like when partically drops there whole life to please me.. freaks me out.. that much heart is scray.. i mean geez.. be your own person please.. V:  Hehe... indeed.  J: *smiles*  * Vitriol and I once had issues, we actually stopped talking to each other due to these issues for like two years ** but where over it now, and better friends than we ever were *** and now joke about the situation **** and use it as a reference in our dicussions hehe.

"       Is simplicity best or simply the easiest?   So begins  urlLink Depeche Mode 's ' urlLink Judas Song ' (off of Songs  urlLink of Faith and Devotion ).  I am thinking of this song now, while  urlLink Jimmy Eat World's  ' urlLink A Sunday ' is playing on repeat. (whew, I have to say that this thought maybe a bit disjointed because it took for-fucking-ever to hyperlink those suckers.  I tried to find lyric pages that didn't have a shitload of pop-ups, but the web is just flooded with them it is really fucking annoying and yes, I have a pop-up blocker).  Anyway.  So I am listening to one of the most depressing songs ever.  And trust me I know depressing songs. And I am thinking back to my sophomore year of high school, listening to 'judas song' in my basement and staring at my oversized poster of depeche mode and being sad and alone like your typical nerdy teenager.  And yet, that is actually how I feel right now. Sad and Alone.  the only difference between now and then is that back then I didn't long to smoke in bed and drink tequilla.    Life would be simpler if I didn't obsess over the most absurd details of my mundane existence.  Life would be simpler if I could forget about Mr. David.  Life would be simpler if I could learn to live alone, if I could be happy practicing guitar five hours a day and reading and drinking alone.  And probably even simpler if I left out the drinking part.  But would it be better?   urlLink The Descent of the Dove .  It's a book a priest loaned me once.  It discusses the two paths to god.  Negative: Abstaining from the physicality of the world so as not to be distracted by it.  Positive: Embracing the physical and finding God in all its aspects.  Williams makes no distinction between either method, both are equally valuable in theory.  But in practice one should not because more concerned about the path than about the destination.  Like anything abstention can lead to fanatical deprivation and involvement can lead to overindulgence.      None of this is anything new or interesting, I know.  But it seems somehow relevant to my life right now.  I don't think I can abstain from depression, but I certainly don't have to revel in it.  Which is what I am doing.  I know that I am bruising my soul, perhaps scarring it even.  But I can't seem to stop myself.    The haze clears from your eyes on a sunday.  on a sunday. What you wish for won't come true. Live with that.  Well, I don't want to live with that.  I want things to go my fucking way, god damnit! I think I am having an electric temper tantrum.  Fuck you MR. David.  Despite all my craziness, which, honestly, happens out of your site, I am really fucking cool.  I am smart (despite the lack of eloquence in these posts) and I am funny (actually funny, not just poop-humor funny) and I am compassionate and caring, but not nice and boring, and I am fucking good at fucking and I am loyal and trust worthy. I think outside the fucking box and don't  rebel just be to a non-conformists like all the other non-conformists.  God damn it david. What the fuck is your problem?  Do you think some 20 year-old  girl  is going to fly across the country to live with you in that shitty little new england town we go to school in?  Do you think she is going to follow you around for years while you pursue your career?  Or do you really think the two of you can manage a 3000 mile long distance relationship for the next four-seven years while she gets her PH.D. (because honestly, what else is a history major supposed to do?)  Yeah, fucking right.  She'll dump you before she turns 22.  Trust me.  It's nothing against her.  She's just young. That's all.  And that's what girls do.     Yeah, yeah, I know I am only 23. But fuck. you're twenty-fucking-six.  There's six years between the two of you and only three between you and me.  And we are both in grad school together and there was a reason you dumped her in the first place? REMEMBER?! she was too young and she couldn't commit.  Do you think six months will change that? Well it won't.   You should call me, you piece of shit.  You should call me and fall for me and make everything okay again.    What you wish for won't come true.    Fuck. I hate it when I sound like this.  Fucking Trite! That's what all of this is.  I have a clear recollection of walking down the street in my hometown.  I was 16, I was hanging out with a friend of mine, a 15 year-old boy.  He started ranting about something or other and I started thinking:  Everything he says has been said before, and in a more eloquent and powerful way.  He sounds just like every other pissed off, isolated and angst-filled teen.  And then I thought: My God! I must sound like that too.   Well damnit.  It sucks to be going through all this emotional melodramatic shit and not even be able to talk about it in an interesting/beautiful/powerful/moving way.  I am so fucking jealous of all of those assholes who can just pick up the guitar and pound out an emotionally driven song, or those fuckers who can just pick up a pen and compose a poem or easy.  Yeah, yeah, I know. You have to  practice  , you have to keep reading, writing, editing.  But let's face it.  Effort only gets you so far without talent.   Okay. Well  that  was attractive, wasn't it?  Sigh.  At least it's better to do it here so I can more easily maintain my facade of calm cool collected detachment.  Okay. no more ranting. time to smoke.          ",female

"       I'm only going to start at today.  Well, maybe last night.  I was sitting on the couch watching a movie with my roommate when the thought 'I hate myself' popped into my head.  I've been very sad lately, personal trouble you understand.  This thought though, it was not mine.  It was directly from the Father of Lies.  He's been starting in on me again lately.  Thoughts that I'm not attractive, that I'm not 'worth anything' that nobody really loves me....  Last night I quickly rejected this thought; said, 'no I don't, I don't hate myself'.  I remembered that we are to love others as we love ourselves.  But first, you have to love yourself as God loves you.  Not with pride or arrogance, but with humility understanding that you are valuable and worth something.  So I told myself all of this and dismissed the thoughts; but still the tears came.  Coursing down my cheeks and plopping on the pillow.       Presently I am reading the book, The Power of a Praying Wife by Stormie OMartian.  No, I'm not married; but I know that I can 'stand in the gap' for Ben and change the course of his life if I will sacrifice a little bit of my time and lay my heart before the Lord.  It is a painful process.  Letting go of what I want for Ben, of my hopes and desires, and praying for God's best for him.  Each day I read a new chapter and pray for that area in his life.  Last night as I crept into bed I picked up the book and read the chapter titled, 'His Mind'.  It was on these very things, these intrusive thoughts, these lies.  It was what I needed to hear and what I knew he needed prayer for.  These are the verses from that chapter: 2 Corinthians 10:3-5 Romans 8:6 Romans 7:23 Romans 7:25 Mark 12:30 Such powerful weapons on fighting the prince of darkness.         This morning I awoke at 7:45 in perfect stillness.  It was the first night in a long time that I had not awoken in the night from a great pain.  I made the LONG reach from the bed to the floor and picked up the book.  This morning it was on 'His Fears'.  Why do the chapters always coincide with my heart?  With that I am fearing for him?   'Perfect Love casteth out fear...' (1 John 4:18) was the verse wrapped it's way around my heart.  I need that perfect love right now.  Sometimes I feel unloveable.  I read the chapter, praying for Benjamin and mulling over the verses.  Psalm 34:7 The angel of the Lord encamps al around those who fear Him, and delivers them.  Psalm 34:4 I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from all of my fears.  Psalm 23:4 Isaiah 41:10 Psalm 27:1  I didn't want to go to church.  I am AFRAID.  I really am a chicken.  I'm not clucking, I mean, kidding.  I have no clue how people get the idea that I'm brave.  If they only knew how I force myself to do things that I'm terrified of....  But I know that it is good and right to go to church, and that it's not going to get any better unless I stick with it and make friends.  I was ready early.  Just sitting on the loveseat, thinking.  Fear and temptation almost overwhelmed me at that minute.  Something screaming, 'take what you can get'.  I wanted to turn back, to reach out a desprate grasping hand for human love instead of waiting in faith on my God.  My mind became clouded and I felt almost sick.  I just started saying verses out loud. 'No temptation has seized you except what is common to man...'  I took a deep breath and left for church.  I know that it sounds silly to say that I was so scared of going to church that I was shaking.  But I was.  Literally.  I just wanted someone to say hi to me, or 'nice to see you here today'.  On the cover of the bulletin was the verse, I Cor. 10:13  I smiled.  God sure is a funny guy.  The message today was on Matthew 4:1-11; temptation in our lives.  I'm not kidding when I say that the guy was talking directly to me.  Oh-to remember that Jesus was tempted in all things, that He understands my heart.  He sees my struggle and my pain and is helping me through it.  Listen to these verses that he brought up!  For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.  Hebrews 2:18  For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 4:15       Several days ago I felt something moving me to read 'Hinds Feet on High Places' again.  So I picked it up.  Many of the same verses and surfaced and my scripture reading, prayer reading, church and this book and parallel.  It's not a coincidence.  God has compassion on His people in their weaknesses.  He sees my heart, He knows where I am broken.  But He also sees how I can be healed and made whole.  It is time for me to willingly take sorrow and suffering by the hand.  To cast aside my fears and the 'what ifs' of the future.  To stop focusing on my pain and the here and now, and to resolutely start climbing the heights.  I know that the enemy is coming out in force now.  He is my only hope.  I want so badly to be changed.  There is so much wickedness in my heart.  So many insecurities that are growing into deep rooted sin that I refuse to give up.  And so my journey continues.  A small chicken who will be given the heart of a lion...         ",female

"         urlLink There MUST Be A Place For The Classics   -  To the very stupid, the study of Latin or Greek may appear a waste of time. To such people, these languages are 'dead' and have no value... Part of the problem is down to the obsession with moving funding to those subjects and those departments which are commercially lucrative. In one sense, that strategy makes sense - where the public sector can work with private industry, it should do so. Certainly, creating tie-ups between the private and public sectors is a sensible move.  But that cannot become a justification for an obsession that each and every academic subject be commercially viable. IBM or Microsoft are never going to seek strategic alliances with classics departments of Scottish universities. But that does not mean that Latin and Greek have no worth. A government that does not see the difference between monetary value and educational worth is not one worthy of being in charge of Scottish education.  The obvious cognitive development, the likelihood of equipping children with the tools to learn other languages more quickly, and the awakening of some sense of the history of world civilisation are only a few of the points to consider. As important are the development of precise analysis and thought, a rigorous mental discipline and, with Latin particularly, an overwhelming emphasis on logic and deduction. Add to that an appreciation of grammar, and you have an utterly compelling case.           ",male

"       The story of the capsizing of the paddlewheeler Victoria on Victoria Day in 1881, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 people, should be a sad-- if forgotten-- moment in Canadian history. Forgotten, it is. But sad? Actually,  urlLink if you read the story , it's almost ridiculous.  The paddlewheeler was apparently overloaded. Capacity was 400 but there are accounts of 600 on-board for the 3.5 mile trip on the Thames River near London, Ontario. The heavily laden boat struck a rock, which opened the hull. The boat began to sink. A group of rowdy teenagers began running from one side of the boat to the other, causing it to tip precariously.   But this didn't stop a group of rowdy teenagers on the lower deck from rushing side to side, rocking the shallow-draft boat so severely her rails almost dipped into the river. They were singing the gospel song One More River to Cross.  When two racing sculls swept past, passengers on both levels rushed to get a look at them. The vessel dipped dangerously starboard. Frightened, the passengers tried to counterbalance the ship by running to the opposite railing. The Victoria dipped even more dramatically to that side, flinging many passengers into the river. At that point, the boat's three-quarter-tonne boiler crashed through its engine room walls and slid across the slanted deck into the river. Along the way, it severed the steam pipes and the pillars supporting the upper deck, crushing and scalding several people. The heavy canvas roof of the collapsed upper deck dropped onto those floundering in the water. As one survivor described it, hundreds were trapped 'like rats in a cage.'   By the way, all of this happened about 40 feet from shore. Frankly, if the boat had tipped the other way, it probably would have flung the passengers onto dry land.  And, as if that's not enough, Macleans goes on:    Rescuers placed the retrieved bodies on the riverbank. Thieves stole personal belongings from the bodies as well as from the garments the rescuers had discarded before jumping into the river. Some owners of hearses, cabs and wagons charged exorbitant rates. And, according to Ken McTaggart, author of London's Darkest Hours, a few even tucked invoices into the dead bodies that they delivered and left propped against the door of their homes.   Well, OK, it is sad. But you gotta admit: the tragi-comic potential is off the charts.         ",male
"                    What a nice day in GA - especially for August !    Everyone got up early and went to the Old Soldiers Day Parade and let  me  sleep in - yea!  Amanda directed traffic and had to take down the barrier because a lady was having a baby in a van - really!!!  She had to let them through to get to the hospital.   Afterwards we went to Mittie's and had a nice lunch and then to get our hair cut.  I thought Amanda was going to go for it and get her hair cut short, but she didn't.  I, on the other hand, did get a lot cut off.  A new haircut always makes me feel better.  My hair stylist, 'Marc', was full of wild tales about Viet Nam and conspiracies.  It was a trip.  Michael is out back with sack-crete and rebar trying to shore up holes in the fence where our little digger   COCO   keeps digging holes.  She digs the hole, then she and her brother   SCOUT   both escape and wreak havoc around the house until some one man handles them back into the fence.   They are quite a duo.  The other day they got into a bucket of   TAR   (left by our thoughtful construction crew).  They spilt it all down the side of the yard and got it all over their hair.  Scout is blonde so it shows up real good on him.   Coco is black so it doesn't show on her.  Amanda spent hours trying to trim the tar off of Scout, but it really was a hopeless case; it will just have to wear off.   At 7:00 everyone is going to North Park for a pick up baseball game.  I'm going to stay home and stay cool.  I will probably take a long soak with some bath bombs and Mango Butter and then put in a Yoga tape.  I just heard a yelp from the back yard and it wasn't one of the dogs... better go see if my hubby is allright.              ",female
"       Yes, I went and saw the Village tonight.  My cousin Stephanie invited me to go with a few of her friends.  We were supposed to see Napoleon Dynamite (and no, I have no clue what it is about).  But it was sold out, so we went and saw the Village.   Which by me, is a much better choice.  Now I won't give anything away...  but it is different from the other M. Night Shyamalan movies.  Still some twists and surprises, he doesn't ever disappoint when it comes to that!  I will give it four stars out of five.  Rated against his other movies, it falls behind Signs and Sixth Sense but way ahead of Unbreakable.  Now for our trenchant political commentary:  Several days ago I was reading some critics' reviews of The Village.  (How's that for a tie in?)  And one critic said that the political commentary in the movie got in the way of the plot.  What political commentary you ask?  Well, I would suggest you only read the following if you have seen the movie so that you won't be looking for it and thus ruin the movie.  You have been warned.  This critic believes that the movie was a commentary about Bush and how he leads the country.  The leader of the village is named Walker, George W. Bush's middle name.  As well the colors yellow and red play an important part in the film.  This critic believed that just as Walker ruled his village through fear, Bush does the same thing with us.  The war in Iraq must be a diversion to keep us from looking at the shortcomings of this presidency.   First of all, I will disagree that M. Night meant to have The Village be a parable for current American politics.  It's too far of a stretch.  Secondly, I disagree that this war is a political ploy.  If it is, it failed miserably.  Watching CNN which I often do, (and I am told is more on the democratic side of things, but which I find much more unbiased than the step-above-a-tabloid Fox Network) there are a lot of stories talking about other pressing issues outside of the war.  Same sex marriage, the economy, employment rates and the like seem to be very important.  Fear is something we've put upon ourselves, not by Bush.   I believe that companies (especially airlines) have seen this new demand for security and are taking advantage of it.  The safety precautions are merely to make customers feel safe.  I (half) jokingly suggest we have pre-9/11 and post-9/11 flights.  And I will tell you truthfully I would ride the post-flights if it meant I can forgo all of the 'needed' security measures.  And I will also hold my opinion even if there is another large terrorist attack on this country.   On a lighter note, I think I have found Kerry's long lost twin brother.  Ironically his twin is President.  In fact, he is president of a planet, Planet Neutral.  Their motto is:  'Live Free or Don't.'  And when in danger, they go to Beige Alert.  Yeah, so I watch Futurama, what of it?     ",male

"             Martha Stewart.  AOL/TimeWarner.  Insider trading scandals have become all too commonplace in the business world these days and a recent trade in Major League baseball may just be the most unethical of them all.  It has long been an unwritten rule that teams not trade players within their own division; but Chicago and Pittsburgh chose to ignore that rule when the Pirates sent Kenny Lofton, Aramis Ramirez, and Randall Simon(all starters) to the Cubs for a few minor league no-names.  This apalling trade has resulted in the Cubs making it to the N. L. Championship series, leaving more honest teams (e.g. Cardinals) home for the playoffs.  Add the fact that Cubs manager Dusty Baker was found guilty of tax evasion last year and you have pretty solid evidence that the Chicago Cubs are nothing but a fraud.  In the business world, the CEO's of fraudulant companies are sent to prison and must pay a hefty fine.  I understand that this is only baseball, so the following are my proposals to remedy this situation. 1) Since the Pirates and Cubs like one another so much, merge the two teams and call them the Chigittsburgh Cubirates.  2)  The Cubs must forfeit all games following the trade, allowing the St. Louis Cardinals to take their place in the playoffs. 3)  Eliminate both the Cubs and Pirates, sending Mark Prior (Pryor?), Kerry Wood and Moises Alou to the Cardinals and moving all others to the Memphis Chicks AAA Team.

We don't meet next week because he's going to Michigan to apply for a position over there.  So I guess I won't be working with him next semester.  In other news, I'm unwillingly embracing the next storm heading our way.  The only reason being that I don't want to drive my dad's car in the snow/ice to school for one class.  It's not worth it, especially since my driving wreck a week ago...My job is fucking horrible.  My boss is annoying and the customers are obviously annoying, but the routine is unbearable.  I graduated school with a degree in communication and certification to teach grades K-8.  The only thing remotely concerned with either of those is talking at work.  I don't listen to most of my coworkers because they are ignorant(except for a few, one being Kim's mother, of course.)

The only thing I have applied for is a job with the nba, but I have no PR experience, so the odds of me actually being hired are slim.  I'm gonna see if my classmates can get me an in or something or give me advice.    Due to the whole accident, our vacation plans are probably nixed.

As much as I can't wait to hear the laughs as Allison's poor little future son walks down the street in his frilly pink frock, and as much as I generally oppose stereotypes of any kind, pink is not a colour for a man! May I point your attention to the episode of Friends with Ross and his pink (sorry, 'salmon') shirt, and the social stigma that was placed on him for it? Despite the ever so 'Macho' Randy Savage's frequent adornment in a very nice neon shade of pink, pink is simply not a masculine colour, nor will it ever be!  Do we need to 'end the narrow minded view of this classic colour', as Allison so nobly is attempting? I say HELL NO!!!!  Keep pink as a gender stereotyped colour! Do we need to allow men to wear skirts, as well, without being tormented and ridiculed? Are men going to start wearing frilly lace panties next? What about lipstick, makeup and bras? Being a girl has few advantages, and one of them is the freedom to wear as much pink as you like! Do we want to give this right away? HELL NO! My father doesn't wear pink, and I'm proud of it!  As a wise person on Miami Vice once said 'real men don't wear pink, and when they do, they pack a gun!'

"        HIGHLIGHTS    INDONESIA – POLITICS   Indonesia: Fragile Democracy   Presidential candidates 2004   Indonesians will head to the polls again on July 5 for the country's first direct presidential election. If no candidate gets the required 50 per cent plus one of the national vote, a second round of elections will be held in September. That round would require only a simple majority for victory.  There are five candidates in the poll: Megawati Sukarnoputri; Wiranto; Hamzah Haz, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; and Amien Rais.    Megawati Sukarnoputri  - Democratic Party of Struggle Indonesia (PDI-P) The staunchly nationalist Megawati Sukarnoputri rose to the presidency in July 2001, as the vice president who replaced ousted president Abdurrahman Wahid.  The daugher of independence hero Sukarno took power with a promise to bring stability to the country as it emerged from decades of authorcratic rule. However, faced with the task of bringing about reform in the wake of the Suharto era, a struggling economy, ethnic tension and the rise of Islamic extremism, Megawati's presidency has garnered mixed reviews. She has been accused of uncommunicative leadership and insufficient action against graft and a faltering economy. In the April 5 legislative polls, Megawati's Democratic Party of Struggle Indonesia (PDI-P) won only 109 seats, compared with 153 in 1999, and she is trailing her former security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, as favourite for president. Megawati has picked the leader of Indonesia's largest Muslim organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Hasyim Muzadi, as her vice-presidential candidate to broaden her appeal. However, analysts predict she faces a tough fight against both Yudhoyono and Golkar's candidate, Wiranto.   Wiranto  – Golkar Former defence minister and Indonesian military chief, Wiranto, surprised many when he was nominated as the Golkar Party's presidential candidate, ahead of the party's own chairman, Akbar Tanjung. Wiranto, 57, has emerged from retirement to run the presidential race and has promised stability, security and strong leadership for Indonesia. Wiranto, who is renowned for his love of singing, has vowed to serve only one term as president if he wins the election.  The former general is facing an arrest warrant by an East Timor judicial body over charges - which he denies - of crimes against humanity related to violence that erupted during the territory's split from Indonesian rule in 1999. International human rights groups have opposed the selection of Wirtanto as Golkar's candidate. However, foreign governments, including East Timor, say they will respect the democratic process in Indonesia and work with the him if he wins the presidency. Wiranto has chosen a human rights champion, Salahuddin Wahid, as his running mate. Wahid is deputy of Indonesia's human rights commission and the brother of former president Abdurrahman Wahid.   Hamzah Haz  - United Development Party (PPP) Hamzah Haz is Chairman of Indonesia's third largest party, the Muslim-based United Development Party (PPP).  The seasoned politician has been President Megawati Sukarnoputri's deputy since she became leader in 2001, but announced his bid for president in the 2004 poll after Megawati chose another Muslim leader as her running mate. Haz, 64, has at times been a controversial deputy president. He once described the United States as 'the king of terrorists' and expressed support for radical Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir before Bashir was arrested as a terrorism suspect. He has chosen the transport minister and former army general, Agum Gumelar, as his running mate.   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  - Democrat Party According to recent pre-election polls, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former Indonesian military chief and chief security minister, is the favourite to win the presidential election.  Yudhoyono, 54, was security minister in President Megawati Sukarnoputri's coalition cabinet until he resigned in March 2004 amid a row with her over his presidential ambitions.  The popular former military chief, commonly known by his initials SBY, is one of the founders of the Democrat Party, established in 2002. The small party gained less than 10 per cent of votes in the April parliamentary poll, placing it fifth, but polls show it is personal popularity that will count most in the presidential race. Yudhoyono has pledged to fight separatism and terrorism and to win back investment if he is elected president.  Yudhoyono has chosen a former Golkar social welfare minister, Jusuf Kalla, as his running mate in the presidential race.   Amien Rais  - National Mandate Party (PAN) Amien Rais was one of the few outspoken critics of harsh government rule under former president Suharto, and was a leader in the nationwide demonstrations that precipitated the standing down of Suharto in 1998. Rais, 60, once led the second largest moderate Muslim group in the country, Muhammadiyah, which has thrown its support behind his presidential bid. In the past five years, the former university lecturer in politics has proved his prowess at the podium as Indonesia's Consultative Assembly Speaker. He has been described as a political opportunist and wildly ambitious, and is known for swinging his ideology from religious right to centre and back. Rais, whose National Mandate Party won less than 7 per cent in the parliamentary elections, has pledged to work safeguard democracy, restore the economy and fight corruption if he is elected president. He has chosen Siswono Yudhohusodo, a nationalist businessman and former minister under Suharto, as his vice presidential candidate.

In its annual report on the region's human rights, Amnesty says authorities are jailing, torturing and possibly even killing people under the guise of cracking down on terrorism.  It also says draconian laws that impinge on human rights are being drafted as part of counterterrorism legislation.  In particular Amnesty has accused China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand of harbouring the belief that human rights can be curtailed under the 'war on terror' umbrella.   It says Hong Kong could have been added to the list had authorities not reacted to a protest by half a million people against security legislation many believed would have eroded civil liberties.    North Korea   The Amnesty report says while the threat of war between the regions newly nuclearised adversaries, India and Pakistan, has eased, thanks to diplomatic efforts, North Korea's resumption of reprocessing activities is a cause for grave concern. North Korea has also been singled out for a litany of offences, including doing little to relieve its population of the famine and starvation that has blighted it for much of the past decade.   Indonesia   Amnesty International says Indonesia resorted to increasingly repressive methods last year in its attempts to crush separatist movements in Aceh and Papua provinces.  The rights group has reported a rise in extrajudicial executions, 'disappearances', arbitrary detention, torture, forced displacement and destruction of property since martial law was declared and a military operation launched in Aceh in May 2003.   It says military operations against both armed and peaceful independence activists in Papua also resulted in human rights violations, including arbitrary detention and torture.   China   The Amnesty report says China's rights record has made little progress in the past year and has worsened in areas such as the treatment of ethnic minorities.   Thailand   Thailand's war on drugs has marred its rights record in 2003.  According to Amnesty International, 2,245 people were killed in the three-month anti-narcotics campaign launched in February, which was aimed at curbing rampant methamphetamine addiction.    Burma   Despite its claims to be pursuing democratic reforms, Amnesty says Burma's ruling junta carried out serious rights abuses in 2003 including a violent attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition. It says some 1,350 political prisoners are languishing in the nation's jails, many of them prisoners of conscience. Among them is democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi herself, who was taken into custody along with other leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) after a May 30 attack on her convoy during a political tour of northern Burma.   Vietnam and Laos   Vietnam and Laos have both been accused of serious violations against freedom of expression. The Amnesty report condemns the Hanoi and Vientiane governments for their arrests and often-lengthy imprisonment of political and religious dissidents.

Officers from the country's central bank recently seized documents from a Port Moresby hotel, targeting yet another pyramid scheme promising fantastic returns for a tiny investment.   Our PNG correspondent, Shane McLeod, reports on the latest in a string of fast money scams, which have taken thousands of people for a ride.  For years fast money schemes have plagued PNG, making promises that are simply too good to be true. Promoters spruik fantastic returns for small investments - hundreds and thousands of per cent for just a few months' use of your money.  Sadly, they rarely deliver, something thousands of Papua New Guineans discover every year. One woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, lost money in a scheme known as Hosava. 'One of them came and talked to me about it and he asked me if I can give him some money, just to invest it somewhere,' the woman says. 'I went there and I gave him $500 and then I did fill out the forms and he told me that after three months I would get the $36,000,' she says. Of course she has never seen the money.    Fooling the public   The country's central bank, the Bank of Papua New Guinea, has wrestled with the schemes for years.  The bank recently targeted another scheme, called Papalain, which is believed to have been operating from a local hotel for months. The bank's deputy governor, Benny Popoitai, describes the people who run these schemes as convincing liars. 'They are normally fast talking people who are able to convince the public to... place money with them, simply because they wanted a fast return,' he says. 'These people, the promoters of money schemes, are liars and they fool the public into placing money with them.'   Scheme promoter on the run   Papalain is just the latest.  The most notorious of recent years was U-Vistract, which promised fabulous wealth to the many thousands who invested in it.  Some of the contributors, usually high profile Papua New Guineans, received their payouts. But most didn't, and were still waiting for their money when the central bank stepped in and closed down the scheme. U-Vistract's promoter, Noah Musingku, is still on the run, facing arrest warrants in PNG and Solomon Islands.  He's now said to be in Bougainville, in the company of reclusive secessionist Francis Ona, and reportedly making more claims about big payouts.  The governor of Bougainville, John Morris, told our reporter, Caroline Tiriman, that Mr Musingku is misleading a lot of people on the island. 'I guess it is convenient for him to hide in the mountains of Panguna and continue to mislead those who are gullible,' Mr Morris says. 'It's taking the focus away from the real issues that the people of Bougainville should be involved in, for example finalising the constitution, working on reconstruction and rehabilitation of life on the ground,' he says.   Anger against bank staff   Mr Popoitai from the Bank of PNG says his officers will continue to pursue the schemes, but concedes not everyone's happy when the schemes are closed down. 'We don't get any more popular. The bank, the staff, and every one of us who do that, we don't get popular at all,' Mr Popoitai says. 'It's not a comfortable thing to do, to go out and tell the public that you just lost your money. So yes, we do not get any popularity out of this exercise. It's not something that we want to do, but we have to do it,' he says. But in an environment where economic challenge is a daily reality, most expect the promise of a quick and fantastic return will continue to attract many.

Australia wants East Timor to honour an agreement signed last year covering the disputed Greater Sunrise field, which would give Australia claim to more than 80 per cent of the gas field. However, East Timor has so far refused. It claims the border should be drawn in the middle of the sea separating the countries, which would place 90 per cent of the oil and gas reserves on East Timor's side.  The argument has heated up in recent weeks, with Dili accusing Australia of stealing its resources and threatening its very future, and Australia vowing to stand by its rights.   The reportage  Four Corners investigates the increasingly rancorous fight between Australia and East Timor over the multi-billion dollar oil and gas bonanza that lies beneath the waters dividing them.  JONATHAN HOLMES, REPORTER: Three weeks ago, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, Dr Mari Alkatiri, swept into the lobby of Dili's best hotel. He'd come to open negotiations to establish a permanent maritime border between his nation, the smallest and poorest in the region, and his richest and most powerful neighbour.   East Timor wants the matter settled within three years. Australia has said it might take 20. It's a David and Goliath contest, and Mari Alkatiri had brought a sling full of verbal stones to hurl at his opponents.   DR MARI ALKATARI, PRIME MINISTER OF TIMOR-LESTE (ADDRESSING CONFERENCE): For us, a 20-year negotiation is not an option. Timor-Leste loses $1 million a day due to Australia's unlawful exploitation of resources in the disputed area. Timor-Leste cannot be deprived of its rights or territory because of a crime.   JONATHAN HOLMES: To open negotiations by publicly accusing your opponents of profiteering from a crime is, by diplomatic standards, like chucking a grenade. The Australian team returned fire with the curtest handshakes in their armoury. Back in Australia, their boss would be even less amused.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: I think they've made a very big mistake thinking that the best way to handle this negotiation is trying to shame Australia, is mounting abuse on our country, um...accusing us of being bullying and rich and so on, when you consider all we've done for East Timor.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Mari Alkatiri is unapologetic. He claims his country is being cheated, and he's going to go on saying so - to his own people, to Australia, and to the world.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I'm here to defend the interests of my people. Of course, there are many ways to do it, but I think that, uh, for a small country, a poor country to be listened to, uh...we need to voice loudly our voice, and that's what I'm trying to do.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Meanwhile, the Australian Embassy has been besieged by angry demonstrators.   PROTESTER (TRANSLATION): We know we have profitable resources, but we know that you are exploiting our oil and stealing it.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Four years ago, these people hailed Australia as their protector. Now they say that they'll be forced to play the beggar unless Australia stops behaving like a thief.   Just over an hour's flight to the south, the gleaming little city of Darwin dreams of future greatness. Across the harbour, in what was pristine wilderness just a few months ago, they're building a plant to liquefy natural gas for export to Japan.   CLARE MARTIN, NORTHERN TERRITORY CHIEF MINISTER: Four out of nine levels of the LNG tank has been constructed, and, uh, it really...in many ways it could double up a sports stadium. I don't know how it compares with Colonial, but it's big.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The gas will arrive through a seabed pipeline from a giant gas field deep beneath the Timor Sea, 500km north-west of Darwin. The Bayu-Undan field lies substantially closer to East Timor than it does to Australia. But just south of Timor lies the Timor Trough, 3km deep in places. Far easier, the oilmen claim, to run the pipeline across shallow seas to Darwin and its First World infrastructure. And far better for Australia too.  BRUCE FADELLI, PRESIDENT, NT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: So far there's been a large influx in construction into the Northern Territory. That's about to gear up even further in June with the start of the laying of the pipeline, so it's been a welcome boost to the construction industry.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the potential bonanza for Darwin lies in a vast, still undeveloped gas field called Greater Sunrise - three times the size of Bayu-Undan, and located still closer to East Timor. Territorians are fervently hoping that that gas will be piped to Darwin too.   BRUCE FADELLI: It's got the potential to create 80,000 jobs Australia wide - 20,000 in the Northern Territory - and the tax revenue benefit from all that investment is in the order of $22 billion over the 20-year life of the project.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The Timor Sea could transform Darwin into an industrial centre, and the Territory into a State. The town of Suai, just across the Timor Sea from Darwin, has no such grand ambitions. This is a different world.   On the whole length of East Timor's south coast, there is not one natural harbour. The fishermen of Suai have to use canoes that are light enough to come in with the surf. These are treacherous waters. The fishermen never travel far from the beach. Their catch is correspondingly modest. Their incomes are tiny, their horizons limited.   You have no thoughts about the oil and the gas out there in the sea there, about who it belongs to?   FISHERMAN (TRANSLATION): I'm sorry, we don't know these things. We don't know who it belongs to. But you can talk to us about fishing.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The women of Suai Loro take a still more modest share of the riches of the Timor Sea. Every morning they walk a kilometre from the village to collect water from the sea. And then, laboriously, they carry it back. Even the fresh water is brackish here. It's hard to eke a living from the salt-laden soil. So the women make their living from salt instead. If you earn a dollar a day in East Timor, you're comparatively rich. These women make much less.   It's taken hours to gather enough firewood for the job. It will take hours more for the water to boil away, leaving a detritus of sea salt. Early next morning in Suai market up on the hill the salt can be sold, or more likely bartered for a handful of rice or a parcel of greens.   KERYN CLARK, OXFAM COMMUNITY AID ABROAD: East Timor is one of the poorest countries in the world. It ranks as the poorest in Asia. Very high levels of maternal mortality, a high level of infant mortality, really poor nutritional practices, very poor food security. So, I think in terms of where I've worked, with often being in-conflict countries, I think really it does compare, unfortunately, with those countries such as Angola, Mozambique.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor, of course, is not in conflict now. But for 24 years it was - until the final paroxysm in September 1999.  This is how the marketplace of Suai looked after the militia and the Indonesian military had finished with it. By the time the INTERFET peacekeepers from Australia and New Zealand arrived in Suai, the culprits had fled into West Timor. The young men who'd been hiding in the hills filtered back into the town to greet their new protectors. Then they went to the ruins of the church, where their wives, their children and their old people had sought the protection of the priests.   Eyewitnesses say the militia used machetes to hack down the priests. The military tossed hand grenades into the church and used machine guns on those who ran out. The fleeing militia trucked corpses and survivors alike over the border to West Timor. Not all have returned. So no-one really knows how many were killed in Suai, but certainly hundreds.   The church has been repaired, the trauma has not and nor has much of the devastation.   KERYN CLARK: Many buildings haven't been rebuilt. There was also massive destruction of people's own assets, so their, um...for example, if they had ploughs or tools that they were working the land with, they've...they've gone. They lost a lot of their animals. They just really lost everything.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But at least East Timor did gain the independence it had fought for so stubbornly for 24 years. With the flags and fireworks two years ago came heartfelt thanks to its neighbour across the Timor Sea.   JOSE RAMOS-HORTA (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): John Howard, you are a friend of East Timor. Your support to our small nation is invaluable and we are delighted to welcome you among us tonight.   JOHN HOWARD (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): This is a very proud day for Australia but, more importantly, I know it is a very proud day for all of the people of East Timor. You deserve every moment of that warmth and pride.   ANGRY PROTESTER (TRANSLATION): We'll scream with all our strength, together as East Timorese. We will never be slaves again. Never again, never again! Long live the people of East Timor!  JONATHAN HOLMES: But now, in many Timorese eyes, Australia has been transformed from saviour to ogre. The argument is ultimately about oil and gas and money. But it's rooted in history and geography and the law of the sea. The Timorese believe it's crucial to their fledgling nation.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): It is a question of life or death, a question of being continually poor, continually begging, or to be self-sufficient.   JONATHAN HOLMES: To find the origins of the dispute, we must go back more than 30 years to when the Portuguese still ruled in Dili. Coup leader, General Suharto, was still consolidating his power in Jakarta. And Australia had become aware that beneath the seabed to its north might lie enormous wealth in oil and gas. In the late '60s, Australia and Indonesia began negotiating a permanent seabed boundary.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS, INTERNATIONAL LAW, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY: The legal background at that time was that the World Court in the North Sea continental shelf cases had just determined that the continental shelf is the natural prolongation of the land territory and that a state has sovereign rights in relation to the continental shelf.   JONATHAN HOLMES: If sea levels were 200 metres lower than they are, the continent of Australia would stretch far to the north. Only the narrow width of the Timor Trough would separate Australia from Timor Island. Australia argued that the Trough marked the edge of its continental shelf and the Indonesians essentially agreed.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: But that was the law then, you know. That was the existing Indonesian legislation and that was also, uh, the normal international legislation at that moment, so considering that one, I think it's somewhat fair at that time.   JONATHAN HOLMES: In 1972, the two neighbours agreed on a seabed border that followed the southern edge of the Timor Trough, much closer to Timor than to Australia. Opposite Portuguese East Timor, they left what came to be known as the Timor Gap. The Portuguese declined to negotiate with Australia to close the Gap. The law of the sea, they believed, would soon change in their favour.   But by 1974, after a coup in Lisbon, the Portuguese hold on East Timor was faltering. President Suharto's generals were advising him to annexe East Timor, by force, if necessary. Australia was trying to decide its own policy.   In August 1975, Richard Woolcott, Australia's ambassador in Jakarta, sent a secret cable to the Whitlam Government, which contained a now notorious paragraph. Australia, he remarked, had an interest in acquiring as much seabed as possible.   AMBASSADOR RICHARD WOOLCOTT, CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA, JAKARTA, 17 AUGUST 1975: This could be much more readily negotiated with Indonesia by closing the present gap than with Portugal or independent East Timor. I know I am recommending a pragmatic rather than a principled stand, but that is what national interest and foreign policy is all about.   CHARLES SCHEINER, INSTITUTE FOR RECONSTRUCTION MONITORING ANALYSIS: And that was Australian policy from that day until 24 years later - at tremendous cost of human life in East Timor.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: You can ask Whitlam and Fraser, but I think that is a complete myth. Um, that is, uh, selectively quoting one document. If that were true, then that would be a theme that ran through many documents and many public statements at the time. I don't think that that was something, which would have been significantly in their contemplation. I'd be certain of that.   CHARLES SCHEINER (ADDRESSING PROTEST RALLY): The Government of Australia should be ashamed of what they've done.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But if you want proof that oil was the key to Australia's policy, say East Timor's supporters, look no further than the Timor Gap Treaty of 1989.   CHARLES SCHEINER (ADDRESSING PROTEST RALLY): And that treaty was illegal and the whole world knew it was illegal, but Australia and Indonesia wanted to take advantage of the dying and the killing and the suffering and the struggling that was going on East Timor.   ONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty was famously signed by Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas in a plane circling above the Timor Sea. It hadn't proved easy, in the end, to close the Timor Gap. The Indonesians had changed their tune, now arguing that the Timor Trough was a geological irrelevance. For years, neither side would give way.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: But in the end we come to the realisation, despite our disagreement in settling this geological quarrel and dispute, we need to do something, and one way of doing it which is justified under international law is to develop a joint development.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty closed the Timor Gap not by drawing a line, but by carving out a joint development zone. Royalties from oil and gas found within it would be split 50/50. The northern border of the zone followed the edge of the Timor Trough. Its southern border marked the halfway point between Australia and East Timor, the so-called 'Median Line'.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: The Australian Government at that time did strike a compromise with the Indonesians, uh, and the Indonesians with Australia, in creating a joint development area and that was a pretty sensible sort of a compromise.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But to Fretilin's fighters in the mountains and its leaders in exile, the treaty was simply a sell-out. The UN had never recognised Indonesia as the lawful ruler of East Timor, but now Australia clearly did.   DR MARI ALKATARI, PRIME MINISTER OF TIMOR-LESTE: We immediately understood why, uh, at that time, Australia decided to recognise the illegal occupation and they...their reasons are the resources in the Timor Sea.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty gave the green light to serious exploration in the Timor Sea. Quite quickly, the oil companies struck viable deposits. The Corallina and Laminaria fields began production in 1999. Fortunately for Australia, both fields lay just south of its border with Indonesia and just west of the new joint development zone. So the royalties flowed entirely to Australia.   That same year, the East Timorese finally got to decide their own future. Chaos and brutality followed. Australia's leadership of the UN intervention force cost the Australian taxpayer a pretty penny. But the Treasury was already recouping at least some of those costs from the royalties from the Laminaria field, which lay much closer to East Timor than to Australia. Even as its soldiers were winning the gratitude of East Timor by securing its land borders, Australia was pushing hard for the continuation of the Timor Gap Treaty in the Timor Sea. But it found itself then, as it finds itself now, up against a feisty opponent.   PETER GALBRAITH, FORMER UNTAET NEGOTIATOR: It was the desire of the East Timorese and of the United Nations to negotiate about borders and we made that clear.   PETER GALBRAITH (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): East Timor is the legal owner of this territory.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Four years ago, Peter Galbraith, at the time an American diplomat, was UN boss Sergio de Mello's choice as the man to take on Australia.   PETER GALBRAITH: He smelt a rat in the Timor Gap Treaty. He thought that the 50/50 split was something that Indonesia had agreed to because it had gotten something in return - namely recognition of the annexation of East Timor - but that under international law, that wouldn't be the right deal for East Timor.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Right from the start, claims Galbraith, he made it clear that East Timor claimed total sovereignty over an area much bigger than the joint development zone.   PETER GALBRAITH: It would be wider to the east and to the west, and it would extend down to the midpoint between the two countries. We showed them maps in October 2000 here in Dili at the start of the first formal round of negotiations on the Timor Sea Treaty. We showed them maps as to what we thought was the correct line and we tried hard to get that line.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Australian negotiators adamantly refused to discuss permanent borders or anything outside the zone, until there was a sovereign East Timorese government to talk to.   PETER GALBRAITH: And so we had no choice. We had to negotiate about arrangements for this area, which is only part of Timor-Leste's maritime space, to see what kind of deal we could get relating to petroleum in that area alone.   JONATHAN HOLMES: On the face of it, they got a pretty good deal. In July 2001, Mari Alkatiri, representing East Timor's unelected leadership, and Peter Galbraith, for the UN, signed a provisional agreement with Australia, which would later form the basis of a new Timor Sea Treaty. Instead of 50%, East Timor would get 90% of tax revenues from oil and gas in the joint development area. The Australians now claim it was a generous concession, which recognised the gross disparity of wealth between the two sides without entirely surrendering Australia's legal position.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: We obviously had a robust negotiation, but in the end we decided that we'd give them 90% of the government revenue on the basis of generosity. I think when a country is generous to another country, to turn around then and accuse them of bad faith is probably not a brilliant negotiating tactic.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The East Timorese, even then, saw it differently.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): We can't understand Mr Downer, Mr John Howard saying they are being generous to us, we can't. According to international experts and international law, if the maritime border is the median line between the two coastlines, we are the one being generous with Australia. We are giving 10% of what belongs to us to Australia.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Peter Galbraith, now a private consultant, has been brought back to Dili by Mari Alkatiri, to lead the East Timorese team in its border negotiations. But he's been making the same argument all along, based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which, since 1982, his team maintains, has changed the law entirely.   PETER GALBRAITH (ADDRESSING MEETING): Nuno will outline the legal case.   DR NUNO ANTUNES, MARITIME LAW ADVISER, TIMOR-LESTE: Equidistance or very slight variations of equidistance - over 60 cases.   If two states lie less than 400 nautical miles apart, they claim, as Australia and East Timor do, the border should be drawn halfway between them, regardless of the shape of the seabed.   PETER GALBRAITH (ADDRESSING MEETING): How many cases support their argument?   DR NUNO ANTUNES: I only know of one, which is the Australian case.   PETER GALBRAITH: In fact the court, in a number of cases, including one between Libya and Malta, explicitly said that where states are less than 400 nautical miles apart, the underlying features are of no relevance whatsoever.   JONATHAN HOLMES: When Australia assigned 90% of the royalties to East Timor back in 2001, says Peter Galbraith, it was because it knew its legal case was fatally weak.   PETER GALBRAITH: They know full well that under international law a court would put the boundary at the median point between the two countries and that would mean that 100% of the resource in the area that was the subject of the Timor Sea Treaty would come to East Timor.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, he would. I mean, he is the negotiator for East Timor. And, I mean, you couldn't call Mr Galbraith an objective analyst or observer in this case.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: I think Australia has a credible case to put.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Professor Gillian Triggs, who's been a commercial consultant to Timor Sea oil companies and advised regional governments on maritime law, believes Australia's claims still have validity.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: But I think it also has to be understood that the 1982 convention still privileges those states that have a continental shelf. In other words, if you actually have a shelf, then you're entitled to the full extent of that shelf.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the Timor Sea Agreement had its advantages for everyone. Crucially, it gave ConocoPhillips and their partners the security to pour billions into the big new gas field at Bayu-Undan, which lies entirely within the joint development area. The LNG plant and the pipeline to Darwin went ahead, bringing jobs and investment in their wake. By 2007, East Timor should be receiving tens of millions of dollars a year in royalties from Bayu-Undan.   But even back in 2001, there were plenty who believed that the secretive negotiations had sold East Timor short. Outsiders were beginning to realise what the negotiators had known all along - that East Timor might well be entitled to total sovereignty, not just over the joint development area, but over tracts of the Timor Sea at either side. The argument is that the lines which define the eastern and western edges of the joint development area are not where they should be. They closely follow lines of equidistance between East Timor and Indonesia. In other words, every point on those lines is an equal distance from the nearest point of land on either side.   But according to Dr Nuno Antunes, a respected maritime law expert who's on East Timor's negotiating team, equidistant lines in this case don't produce a fair result - and international law demands fairness.   DR NUNO ANTUNES: For example, this line here, which is the line to the west of the JPDA, is completely influenced by one single point here, which is on the Indonesian coast, and why? Because if you...if you notice, this point is very close to the boundary and is very prominent, and it has an undue impact that international lawyers identified as, uh, a special circumstance, and that special circumstance should be object of relief - i.e., in a way that would turn the boundary to this side.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Similar though different arguments apply to the eastern border of the joint development area, says Dr Antunes.   DR NUNO ANTUNES: And that would be my opinion why these lines have to be opened to accommodate to a further extent the rights of Timor-Leste.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS, INTERNATIONAL LAW, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY: On the, um, authorities that I've read, that part of the coastline to the western side of East Timor is a relatively smooth coastline and is one from which an equidistant line can properly be drawn, but there is always another view, and indeed, if so, then that should be discussed and negotiated.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Even a small adjustment to the lateral lines could make a dramatic difference to East Timor. If a maritime boundary were agreed only slightly to the west, East Timor would gain all the royalties from the Laminaria oilfields - perhaps another $300 million a year for the next few years. Far more lucrative is the massive Greater Sunrise field to the east. Based on the current line, 20% of the field lies inside the development area, and 80% under the Australian seabed. The Timor Sea Treaty agrees to divide the royalties accordingly. But shift the line just a few kilometres eastward, and those proportions might be reversed - putting billions of extra dollars East Timor's way over the next 30 years.   JOSE TEIXEIRA, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INVESTMENT, TIMOR-LESTE: We don't take the view that these resources belong to us in this generation. These resources belong to future generations of Timorese. We are committed to sustainable development of this country. We are committed to a permanent petroleum fund that will utilise these resources in a sustainable manner, not just for us, but for our children, our grandchildren, our grandchildren's children. That's what it's all about.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor's total budget today - for education, for health care, for infrastructure, for security - is around $100 million - that's a good bit less than the Australian Sports Commission's. But even that much money is hard to find. From people as poor as this, there's precious little tax to be raised. International donors' funds are already drying up. The revenue from Bayu-Undan will enable East Timor to subsist for the next 20 years. But $8 or $10 billion extra, wisely used, could theoretically provide financial security and real development for the long term.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): We know we can develop this land, give our people a better life, and we feel that this opportunity is being taken away from us. And on top of that, it's something that belongs to us.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: If there is an issue of economic disparity between Australia and East Timor, that should be addressed through aid programs, which it is, um...and other mechanisms. That should not be addressed through shifting boundaries and changing international law.   JONATHAN HOLMES: That professed regard for international law rings somewhat hollow in some ears, because in March 2002, just weeks before East Timor gained its independence, Australia announced it would no longer accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice on matters relating to its maritime borders.   CHARLES SCHEINER, INSTITUTE FOR RECONSTRUCTION MONITORING ANALYSIS: Australia claims to be a democratic country. It claims to be a law-abiding member of the world community. Uh, they've...Australia has withdrawn from the courts. Can I commit a crime, then withdraw from the court and say, 'No, the court had no jurisdiction'? My neighbours wouldn't be very happy about that.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We have said that we would rather negotiate all of our arrangements with other countries, not just with East Timor, but with Indonesia. And remember, we have to think about our other relationships when we think about this relationship. We will determine all of those on a bilateral basis. Not having courts and arbiters and, you know, people over there in the Hague deciding on our relationship.   PETER GALBRAITH, LEAD NEGOTIATOR, TIMOR-LESTE: Australia's decision to withdraw from the International Court of Justice reduced East Timor's opportunities to get a fair maritime boundary in accordance with international law. There's no question about it.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The eve of Independence, in May 2002. Behind the scenes, the new nation's leaders are under huge pressure. The oil companies and the international donors, as well as Australia, were insistent that their first action must be to sign and then ratify the Timor Sea Treaty.   A chorus of voices at home and abroad had been urging the new Prime Minister not to trust Australia, not to sign, to hold out. But he ignored them. A rival oil company has even filed suit in the USA recently, alleging that ConocoPhillips, the operator of Bayu-Undan, paid millions of dollars to Mari Alkatiri for his signature.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I never received any single coin from anybody.   PETER GALBRAITH: Those kinds of allegations are, um...crap.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Alkatiri says his country desperately needed the money from Bayu-Undan and he believed the Treaty would give him the leverage to pressure Australia into negotiating new permanent borders. When Alexander Downer next came to Dili a year later, it looked as though Alkatiri had succeeded.   DR MARI ALKATARI (ADDRESSING PRESS CONFERENCE): It's formally recognised already that there are overlapping claims in the zone. That's why we're going to initiate a new process of negotiation on maritime boundaries. We will do it.   ALEXANDER DOWNER (ADDRESSING PRESS CONFERENCE): We have lively negotiations, Australia and East Timor, because we're lively and interesting and entertaining people. So, um...we'll look forward to that. (Laughs)   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Australia's been in no hurry. Two years after independence, the first substantive negotiating session's just been held. At Australia's insistence, six months will pass before the next one. In East Timor, they plant and harvest a rice crop in less time than that. From the paddy fields of Suai to the government in Dili, a sense of impatience and even betrayal has been growing.   MARIA AMARAL (TRANSLATION): That's why I'm asking the Australian Government to resolve the oil issue quickly - so that our young ones will be able to work and look after their younger siblings and we will be able to send our children overseas to study.   JOSE TEIXEIRA, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INVESTMENT, TIMOR-LESTE: It's become quite clearly evident, particularly in the latter part of last year, that in fact what was always intended to be an interim provisional treaty was in fact going to be used to extract a permanent benefit.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor claims Australia is in flagrant breach of international law by continuing to take the revenue from the oilfields of Laminaria. They're in an area, they say, which even Australia has recognised is in dispute. Yet in a few years, there'll be no oil left.   PETER GALBRAITH: I don't expect the Australians to come to some quick conclusion. I don't expect them to change their position, but I think they should be in the same position as East Timor - that is, nobody gets the resource until we can agree who gets the resource, and that's exactly what has been required under international law.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Even Professor Triggs acknowledges that there's a case for putting the royalties from Laminaria into a trust account until the matter's resolved.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: It's not for me to tell the Government what to do, but I think that if there is any credibility to the East Timorese argument on shifting that line further to the west, and if that were to be determined on any objective assessment of the law and of the geographical features that you mention, then there's a very good argument for putting the funds in escrow for a period.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the Government doesn't appear to accept that East Timor's claims have sufficient credibility to justify any such action.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, our response is that we're there in the Australian area, in the Australian maritime area, and that we will treat them - those areas - as such. I do make this point. I don't think that the tactic of strident rhetoric and denunciation of Australia - accusations of greed and ill faith and so on - I don't think that tactic in the end, which is a big surprise to us after all we've done for East Timor, I don't think that is going to prove to be very successful.   JONATHAN HOLMES: It's true that East Timor has been blatantly playing to the gallery. It claims it has no other choice.   DR MARI ALKATARI (ADDRESSING CONFERENCE): In addition to blocking a judicial resolution of our maritime dispute, Australia is unilaterally taking the resources from the disputed area.   RADIO ANNOUNCER (TRANSLATION): Australia should respect the people and help us for the future. It shouldn't exploit a small, poor country. We are poor because our resources are in the sea. We are not able to exploit them.  JONATHAN HOLMES: But Mari Alkatiri does have one more card, and he's played that too. Investment in the all-important Greater Sunrise field can't go ahead until the East Timorese Parliament ratifies yet another complex treaty governing how it's to be taxed and the revenue divided. Dr Alkatiri's government signed the so-called Unitisation Agreement last year. But in the current sour climate, he claims, even his own party, Fretilin, would vote against ratification.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: I think their idea here is that they think that they'll get more concessions out of us by delaying ratification of the Unitisation Agreement and, um...  JONATHAN HOLMES: Will they?   ALEXANDER DOWNER: I think, um... I think not, no. We've reached agreement on unitisation. The best strategy for them is to build good will.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Sunrise can't go ahead, can it, unless that's ratified?  ALEXANDER DOWNER: It won't go ahead, no.   JONATHAN HOLMES: When the border negotiations finally began three weeks ago - months later than East Timor would have liked - the diplomatic niceties were observed. But only just. The talks themselves, from East Timor's point of view, were little short of a disaster.   PETER GALBRAITH, LEAD NEGOTIATOR, TIMOR-LESTE: I don't think these negotiations are going any place at all because the Australian side has refused to talk about the key issue, which is - where are the lateral lines? And why is that the key issue? Because that's where the money is. The location of those lines means the difference between $4 billion for East Timor and $12 billion for East Timor. The Australian position is that that is not on the table. That's not a matter that's subject to negotiation.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We will talk about anything, but we have our own claims, remember? I mean, I know they have their claims. I know they have their claims and I know they have their arguments, and I've seen in the media the fairly strident things that they've had to say, including denouncing my country. I've seen all that and I know all that. But, remember, we have our claims. And we want to stick with our international legal principles, principles that have served us in relation to negotiations with Indonesia, with Papua New Guinea, with New Zealand.   JONATHAN HOLMES: It's Indonesia, as always, that really matters to Australia. The next government in Jakarta may be still harder to deal with than the current one. Australia is determined that East Timor's border claims should not provide another source of friction with its biggest neighbour or, worse still, call into question its longest maritime border.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Some of the claims they're making in relation to the lateral boundaries will make those lateral boundaries closer to Indonesia than to East Timor. Well, that, of course, isn't a proposition...that isn't a legal proposition that is going to stack up. And that's going to get them into a lot of difficulties with Indonesia.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Indonesia will argue that its seabed boundaries with East Timor should follow the lines of equidistance. Any concession by Australia on lateral boundaries would involve concessions by the Indonesians too. They're unlikely to be cooperative.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: I cannot see the reason on what basis that line north-south on this side should be changed. I don't find any justification, and I think East Timor would have difficulty in arguing it.   PETER GALBRAITH: That is a matter to be negotiated both with Indonesia and with Australia, and, of course, East Timor wants to negotiate with both countries. But there's real urgency to the negotiations with Australia and there is no urgency with negotiations with Indonesia. Why is there urgency to the negotiations with Australia? Because, as we speak, Australia is pumping petroleum out of the area that is under dispute, the Government is getting $1 million a day, and so that already, since 1999, $1.5 billion is gone. Every day that we delay is $1 million less for this country.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I think that it is time for the Australian Government to listen to its own people. The people is voicing loudly on this issue and it's better to listen to their own people.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The Timorese seem to believe that the Australian public will be as sympathetic to their cause this time around as it was four years ago. But their loyal supporters in Australia are finding the going tough.   MAN (ADDRESSING RALLY): Today is the formation of the Timor Sea Justice Coalition in Darwin, and this is our first action. Ironically, the enemy has changed from being Indonesia to Australia...   JONATHAN HOLMES: Massacres are one thing, maritime borders quite another. So far, the issue has hardly set Australia alight. The Howard Government seems confident that most Australians will applaud it for hanging tough.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We will do what we believe to be right, but, of course, in our interests, we are on Australia's side. I'm the Australian Foreign Minister. The obligation on me is to negotiate for the 20 million people in Australia.   PETER GALBRAITH: All we ask is that Australia stop taking the resource until we have an agreement, or that Australia negotiate seriously and rapidly about all the issues, including the lateral boundaries, or that Australia agree to an impartial decision by an international court of Australia's choosing. Any one of those three.   JONATHAN HOLMES: A rapid resolution seems unlikely. There have been harsh words and bitter feelings on both sides. There's no mood at present for pragmatic compromise. It's undeniable that the relationship has soured. Most Australians still feel proud of what their nation did to help its tiny neighbour. But for an Australian in East Timor these days, gratitude is hard to find.

The move could see the country driving down the worldwide price for the medicine. But international experts caution that quality must be assured. In response to a mushrooming HIV/Aids epidemic that has seen many poor farmers affected, the Chinese government in December 2002 gave approval to several domestic pharmaceutical firms to make generic versions of Western drugs whose patents had run out, to try to lower the cost of treatment.  So far, four Chinese companies are producing the anti-Aids medicine.  Shanghai-based Desano Biopharma Corp is exporting seven kinds of raw materials to India, Thailand and Brazil, the Xinhua news agency said.  According to Desano, its partner in South Africa reduced the annual medicine fee for an Aids patient from more than US$10,000 (S$17,000) to US$3,000 after using its materials.  However, international experts said China's Aids drugs have not passed standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).  'Lots of efforts are needed for the improvement of quality,' said Mr Zhao Pengfei, the WHO's HIV/Aids coordinator in China.  Currently, some 7,000 Aids patients in China are taking the Chinese anti-retroviral cocktail treatment under a pilot programme, but health officials have said about 20 per cent of them stopped due to severe side effects. Health experts said they supported having more Aids drug producers if the quality could be controlled.

The surplus with Asia, the largest export market for Japan, expanded in a year to Y667.2 billion ($8.5 billion), to post a 10th consecutive monthly gain.  Asia-bound exports rose 19.6 per cent to Y2.49 trillion, with shipments of cameras and other optical equipment jumping 42.2 per cent, and electronic parts up 13.4 per cent.  Exports of steel products to Asia rose 25.7 per cent due to a shipbuilding boom in South Korea, a ministry official said.  Japan's exports to China rose 18.8 per cent while imports from China grew 12.9 per cent.  'The pace of growth in exports to China somewhat slowed as exports to China have until recently been rising 30-40 per cent year on year,' the official noted.  He said it was uncertain whether the slowdown might have been caused by anti-inflation measures by the Chinese banking regulators, such as reducing money in circulation.  Shuji Shirota, senior economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo, said: 'Japan's deficit with China has been shrinking due to increased exports but the latest data showed export volume was falling slightly.'  Imports from Asia climbed 9.1 per cent to Y1.83 trillion as purchases of electronics parts, such as semiconductors, increased 29.2 per cent.  Imports of office equipment, such as computers, rose 20.8 per cent and audio-video devices were up 27.0 per cent.  'The basic picture of pretty strong growth of exports is unchanged and I think that's still the main positive news for the economy going forward,' said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities.  Japan's overall trade surplus in April rose 30.3 per cent to Y1.08 trillion. The surplus with the US fell 2.4 per cent to Y553.5 billion.  The surplus with the European Union expanded 1.6 per cent to Y275.2 billion.  'The figures confirm Japan's economy is still dependent on external demand. And it's becoming clear that its reliance is shifting towards China and other Asian economies from the United States,' said Toshihiko Matsuno, a senior strategist at SMBC Friend Securities.  Although gross domestic product data last week showed that exports were no longer the biggest contributor to Japan's economic recovery, economists said they remained a key factor underpinning the domestic turnaround.  The GDP data showed that the economy grew a real 1.4 per cent in the first three months of this year, with external demand accounting for just 0.2-percentage point of the expansion.

Officers from the two sides sat together at 10 a.m. at the resort of Mount Kumgang, on the northern side of the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that bisects the Korean peninsula and separates some 1.8 million troops, South Korean defence ministry officials said.   Five-member delegations headed by South Korean Commodore Park Jung-hwa and North Korean Brigadier General An Ik-san were expected to hold about two hours of talks focusing on avoiding naval clashes in the Yellow Sea west of the Korean peninsula.  In recent years, the rich fishing grounds have been the scene of naval clashes during the crab-fishing season in May and June that have killed or wounded scores of sailors on both sides.   The two Koreas technically remain at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. The defence ministers of the rival Koreas met once in 2000 and more junior officers have worked together successfully in the building of rail and road links through the DMZ.

"          By Deanne Lane  (KSDK) -- It's a world famous photograph, showing a man wearing military camouflage holding Saddam Hussein down on the ground. What few people knew, until now, that man lives in the St. Louis area.   'I just told myself it can't be, no way,' says 34 year old Samir. He's asked us not to use his last name, or identify exactly where he lives.  Samir worked with the military as an interpreter. He was at the remote farm on December 13th, when U.S. forces discovered a secret hiding place. The next few minutes will feel like a lifetime for Samir.  'We saw the hole for the bunker but it hard to believe someone live in that hole. It was really small,' Samir remembers. 'They shot in there and he started yelling, 'Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't kill me.'' So I had to talk to him. I was the translator. I said, 'Just come out.' He kept saying, 'Don't shoot. Don't kill me.''  In Arabic Samir said he continued to pursuade Saddam to come out. He was about to come face to face with the tyrant who killed his loved ones. Saddam was the reason he fled Iraq in 1991 and eventually moved to St. Louis.   -- How come the media isn't showing this? I think this is HUGE! How great is it to the Iraqi people that a person from their background found this terrorist in that RAT hole.   Andrew B.     ",male

"       the big question of the weekend has been:  What to get Grant for his birthday?  I am starting to get an inkling of an idea...we shall see. I was going to get him a winter hat (as he has none and it is very pitiful and makes me cold just to look at him) but 'we don't start getting those in until the end of September' was the response I've gotten from the places I've looked. Sigh.   Grant's birthday means it is Chris' too! Perhaps a phone call to Boston will be made...and, Hurray! today is the last day of Drum Corps. Perhaps we'll start seeing some old friends more regularly now. Can't wait for move-in time, when everyone will start ringing our doorbell and visiting again.    I yelled at Ryan yesterday, but he laughed at me. Ok, so it was kind of funny. He called to find out if there was a party at Issac's, and I had no idea so I said, 'how the hell should I know if there's a party at Issac's?!?!' But he didn't hear me (something up with his phone)  so I had to repeat it about five times and each time I got angrier until finally he did hear me and he chuckled, that Ryan-chuckle thing that usually delights me but just ended up being terribly annoying at the time. Anyway, didn't go to Issac's, and didn't call Ryan back (as he said, call me if you're going, and not, call me either way mwahahahaha!). thought about other things. mostly about how to get back at Kris Nonn for ragging on me all the time. So far, I have not come up with any solutions. Tonight is the last night I have to put up with it though, it's all good.  We are having a party after the show...hopefully people will come and have a good time. At any rate, it's time to go out into the world and get some fresh air.          ",female

"   I'm a little less than pleased with Blogger's new  urlLink WYSIWYG functionality , because apparently it doesn't apply to  urlLink Opera  users. Now I can't even preview my posts.

'Like scores of other web-savvy folks, I ran away from IE screaming about a month ago. My browser of choice is now Opera. For whatever cross-browser incompatibility reason, I don't see the new WYSIWYG interface, and what's more, I've lost the ability to preview posts altogether. This is true even when I set Opera to report itself as IE, so I'm assuming it's an ActiveX thing. Anyway, it's unfortunate.

"            Dreams Do Come True...    urlLink WXRT  now is (finally) steaming over the internet.  Trust me, no matter how long and hard people in Chicago complain XRT is not what is used to be, it's still at least 10 times better than almost anything else around the country, and especcially here in Rockford.  Is it what is used to be?  No, of course not.  But the strength of the station is the music  and  the DJs.  People listeners have known for more than a decade.  I would have paid to hear Bobby Skafish and Lin Brehmer and Tom Marker again.  Now I get to hear them for free.  In the first of a series, I present songs I probably would not have known about if not for XRT Streaming on the net:  Jack Johnson --  Taylor :  I liked  Flake , and I do think Johnson is more than Dave Matthews lite.  The songs I've heard from him do a great job of creating mood and feeling.   Taylor  does this perfectly and is a great acoustic guitar workout too.  At the very least it beats hearing Britney Spears for the 100th time on the Top 40 station out here or more Jackson Browne on the classic rock station.     urlLink Full Post and Comments          ",male
"             'and here I am trying to catch up with my self,   delusional between awareness glimpses and the  numbness of everyday nonsense...'  Life has been kind to me latelly, this new business is very interesting, it's about technology, 2nd place in the 'entrepreneur' magazine, and it's pretty much about having a share of a huge international company. For some reason it came into my life at this moment... just when I was wondering how to make some good money...   Anyway, several interesting things have happened, one was that I was offered to teach 3 different groups in highschool next semester!!!!... teaching a whole new topic, that pretty much wants to make the students smart... The course wants to get the best of out them, teaching them reasoning, problem solving, creative thinking, and language ontology (zpelling?)... things of the sort. It's one of those courses that the guys can just 'fly by', or one of those that can make a difference in someone's life. I am striving for the 2nd choice.   One of the 'issues' is that Tanya, my ex-gf could be my student... now there is one to think about it. But I have talked about it with her, and just as I thought, it's all cool and there is no reason why we should make a deal out of it. Now the 2nd part is the way the highschool is, so strict... and the way I am... so 'rebel' in terms of institution and all... he he he... there is the callenge. I guess I will take those classes, and it's not about the money, it's about the challenge and how much I will learn... this blog, of course, shall be a witness of all that happens.  On the other hand yersterday I had a talk with Abby!!!... wow!!... I loved it... it was pretty much 'basic', but it was great to cross some words with her again. Just as I was writting her an email, she wrote me a message through msn. (I added her to my new list, and there she was!!). It may sound silly and all, but it was special to me. Mostly because of the way that I feel, of how much I've grown and 'closed circles', and now I feel like I want everyone I've ever cared for around me... he he he. Too bad she's in Chicago, other wise I would invite her to have coffee and all... it's great to have a she-friend... he he he, and even better if you dated her, and now she's all about giving you tips and advices, and being a good friend. (it kind of happens with sara).  As well I had a great lesson today... I 'wasted' about 5 to 6 hours going from a business to a business asking for a cooperation for 'Casa Mision San Pablo' (the shelter with kids that have HIV), and I realized two things: 1) I wasn't making money... 2) I was fullfilling my idea of recognition, being seen, being smiled at, etc, etc... While apparently I wanted to make money, all I wanted was to be seen, trying to make money for this guys, and to be the 'nice young fellow who has a great heart' in the eyes of others... Now this is a harsh judgement, but it's quite true!!... and once someone helped me to realize it, I changed the pattern and generated a whole event in a pretty cool place, and all the earnings from that day will be for the shelter!!!... now there is a difference...   It's all in the attitude... for real... whenever something is not going quite as planned, all you have to do is to stand, think, and realize what is it, deep inside, that is keeping you from achieving a goal, or which 'stronger subconscious goal' is being a obstacle for this achievement. Weeeeird... but real... it's all in a metaphysics book!...  And to close, sarah, abby's sister, is having a baby!!... GOOD FOR YOU GIRL!!... YOU'LL MAKE AN AWESOME MOM... wow... keep it up... a huge hug for you!.  ** cheers then         ",male

It's just about all I can do to get out of bed and go to the desk where this computer is and turn on the computer and open the internet and access this blog and then type something and then publish something on it. And I'm not tired from being tired from no sleep, either: I'm tired because it's hard to have only one eyeball when you're supposed to have two, and to have to face lie to everyone you meet or be a wierdo person who just talks about his glass eye. I've been talking to you for a while so I guess I can be honest to you: I don't have one of my eyebrows because of them fixing the hole where my eyeball was and a couple of guys have laughed at me because of that fact, and I just kind of wish that I didn't have to have that happen to me and didn't have to go my whole life with a scar on my eyelid (very big) and a glass eyeball and never feeling attractive to ladies. And here is why: honestly a little before I started writing this blog, [I am so sorry that I never told you this but some things are personal.]  I was broken up with my a girl that had been my girlfriend for a long time: four and a half years, which is like forever when you are young.  This is making me sad so I'll give the bigger update when I am feeling better.  Here's a thing:  since I only have one eye to cry out of I have to cry for twice as long.

Im still having fun in London, i love it here.   uhm.   ive seen a bunch of plays, i guess.. i saw Les Miserables, The complete works of William Shakespear (which was like, a takeoff thing of shakespeare) and chicago. i went and did all the touristy stuff, which was cool. My aunt took a tour of the tower of london which was boring so i wandered off and talked to some french kids even though i suck at french. we went on the london eye, which is the tallest ferris wheel in the world, and it was REALLY tall. and we went to the london dungeons which sucked ass. ALL OF YOU- NEVER GO TO THE LONDON DUNGEONS UNLESS YOU ARE UNDER 12 YEARS OLD. IT IS BORING AND TOURISTY AND CHEESY AS HELL.  whew. anyway. and uh. i tried to make the guys with the fuzzy hats laugh, but then after about 2 minutes i got bored of that because they never laugh and i just felt stupid trying.   oh yeah! and i went to the Westminster abbey this morning for CHURCH at 8 AM! because my aunt wanted me to experience a service in a major church, i guess. Ugh. it was boring and early and they kept giving me horrible looks and my uncle kept being all 'is this what you normally wear when you try to show your respect for another country's beliefs?' and i was like 'wtf, i didnt plan on bringing clothes to go to church in...'  so.  uh. i went and hung out on camden (again) with the same people (again.)i met this really funny german kid named alex who didnt speak a whole lot of english but thats ok, he was hilarious anyway. he was trying to tell me about his piercings, hes the only other person ive ever seen with the bridge of his nose pierced (like liz) and we just sat around, again. OH, and then i had to go home and he was trying to help me get around the underground, but i got lost as hell anyway and then he had to go meet his girlfriend i guess. anyway, even thought it probably doesnt sound like it, it was fun.  oh! last night i went to a street fair, because it was really close to my house. it was in the street a couple of blocks away from my flat, and my window opens really easily so i just went. It was a bunch of drunken british people wandering around, and there was some band playing and some drunken girl gave me some champagne.   i still have  my mushrooms, i got a LOT...i dont even know how much it weighs, im gonna weigh it when i get back to colorado. a lot of mushrooms, though. like 20-30 stems? anyway. somebody is eating pasta and i really want some, cause it smells really good. i figured out how to put pictures that i took on the internet, but i am horrendously stupid and i forgot to bring my camera to the internet cafe thing.  i had to ship my bullet belt home today, im going to be so pissed if it doesnt come through customs... i payed more to ship it than i did to BUY it. stupid british postage costing a gazillion dollars.   anyway. i come home on saturday, thats in 2 days... i think my plane gets in around 6:30 pm.

             so I think that God has given me something amazing to remember that whether we were in His will at the time or not that He is going to bless my marriage with Jordan no matter how tough it get's. Hanah and I went to the Bebo Norman concert a week ago and it was incredible. I never really knew how amazing he was until that night. To make a long story short he told the audience about this song that he had written for a married couple that were very close friends to him. He explained that he wrote this song for them because these 2 people had every reason to want to give up but both of them took convenant very seriously and knew that God would get them through it as long as they leaned on him. Bebo played the song and there were tears streaming down my face and I went and got the cd and listened to it and once again was sobbing I just want to give you the chorus right now and give you the rest later.  I will not give up this fight  I will not lay down and die I will not carry this heart of stone I may not be your place to run I may not be your kingdom come  I may stumble through this great unknown But I will be all that is true I will not give up on you I was made to be with you alone Cause you and me we're gonna see the long way home.         ,female

"       My polling station was inside a Catholic nursing home. The door was locked and the lady at the desk was talking on the phone. I stood there waiting for someone, anyone to let me. Finally, a nun passed by and after convincing her that my voter's card and lack of any other reason to visit a Catholic nursing home was proof of my legitimacy, she opened the door. I have the feeling she's been doing that all day. She craves the power.  I'm not happy about my choice but I've known what I would do for the past week or so. I toyed with the idea of using the last-minute-menu-ordering system - when unable to choose between several menu items, you wait until the waitress asks what you'd like and then blurt out the first thing that comes to mind.

"       KITTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, that's right, a goth kitten.  :D  I weighed myself today. I weigh far too much. Over summer I'm going to eat less fatty foods, limiting myself to one chocolate bar (not mars, probably a kitkat or small bag of malteasers) per month (may seem extreme but meh, less chocolate is good), taking packed lunches to school, not having so much sugar in tea and on cereal, walking places instead of taking the bus, walking the dogs religiously every weekend with my nan, doing more general exercise for fun, too. I mean, I enjoy basketball, volleyball, badminton, tennis and swimming, so I'm gonna start going swimming with my friends a bit, playing tennis once a week with my uncle/cousin/somebody, I play basketball at home anyway, I could even walk down to the park and play there, my aunt plays badminton so I could play with her, volleyball I could join the school team next term. It seems logical to me. Also, I'm going to eat more salady stuff with food, I barely ever eat salad, that's healthy, so I should eat more salad. *nods* I'm gonna lose at least two stone, preferably more. And I'm hoping I should be able to do it by the end of the Christmas term, realistically. Which means NEW CLOTHES FOR CHRISTMAS! :D Joking, joking.  Anyway, yeah. Not much has happened to be honest... We finally managed to record Voices yesterday.  I've just dried my hair, and it looks all pretty! I'm discussing my eating habits with Marcus and feeling ashamed. I need to eat a bit less. Well, not less, I don't eat THAT much, but what I do eat is usually quite fatty/greasy/sugary/all three. Marcus says not to mess with my diet too much otherwise my metabolism's gonna screw up, and if large figures run in my family (which they do) to be proud of it. But I'm not proud of it, I don't wanna end up like my mum - turning 40, fat and unable to lose weight, single mum and the only guy who'll have me tears me away from my family. I want to be a relatively pretty, successful girl with a lot to live for, and if I hae to work for that then so be it.

"       Today as I was dragging my kids around the mall... out of the mall, to be more accurate, I stumbed past a Brand New For Fall plaid skirt. A gorgeous skirt. A skirt I'd actually buy instead of walking past, thinking, 'I can make something much nicer than that.' And it was $32. A bargain (not really, but hey....).   Ten skirts on the rack and all of them are a size six. I checked other racks. Nope. I asked a sales clerk (visibly NOT a size six herself) and was informed that what was on the rack was what there was.   Well folks, I'm going to be 36 this year. I haven't been a size six in living memory. In fact, I will never again be a size 9 and am likely to spend the rest of my life as a size 12-14, and that's that. I exercise, I eat well, for the most part. I yam what I yam.  So I took the skirt in my hand and walked back to the Guest Services desk. Behind that counter were three other women. After excusing myself in advance for being upset, I elegantly slid the skirt onto the desk.  'Look at this beautiful skirt.'  Looks of confusion.  'It's a size six. There are ten skirts on the rack, and they are all size six....' I pointed to one of them, 'Are you a size six?'  'No'  'I'm a size six,' says the one in the middle. So I look at the third one, 'How about you?' 'Not me.'  So I proceeded in the most apologetic and self-righteous way possible to explain that fat people like nice skirts too, and would they please pass it on to whoever does the bloody ordering that NOT EVERYONE IS A FUCKING SIZE SIX.  In case you are wondering, size six is really small. It's like pencil thin. At least, it is to me. For the more anorexic size ZEROES, it's probably fatty fatty two by four to be a size six.

Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed, Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles.'  Great stuff.  Achilles was the perfectly designed 'Greek-killing Machine'.

So far it has some stuff on Chinese ownership of movie production and distribution, and a small section on how Indian and American films were competing in Indonesia for market share in the 1950s. This is really interesting for me, given what I'm hoping to do for future research. The book, however, seems to be mostly about nationalism and building (kind of whatever for me).  ***         ",male

"             it was good.  i have trouble sometimes building something up in my head so much that it can never hope to live up to expectations.  i'm certain i'm not the only person that does that sort of thing, and that the people that do make up much more than a small minority of the population.  that happened when i saw office space for the first time, although, i think that was primarily due to the fact that the movie had been ridiculously talked up by those who'd seen it before.    luckily, it's not a problem i had this weekend, and it's usually not a problem when i get to reunite with a friend, especially one that i haven't seen in a while.  duncan was here last night and i'm gonna say all the stuff you'd probly expect me to say, it was great to see him, awesome catching up, stuff like that.  what dawned on me about this friendship in particular is that there's a definite ease in it, there's no pressure, no expectations, we could have sat on the couch and looked at the walls, or sat out on the back walkway while he smoked all night and not regretted a second.  i thought about it some more and began to realize that that ease is present in pretty much every friendship i have, it felt nice.  the whole thing is double-edged however, because after having been here nearly a year, i don't feel like i've met anyone who can be as good a friend as any of the friends i have already.  i don't know whether to feel discouraged about that, maybe because of an inability to relate to people or a fear of letting new people into my life, or if i was just terribly,terribly blessed by the people that have been in my life before.  i think i've become pretty picky about it, more and more i find myself becoming increasingly stringent about the definition of the word 'friend.'  i don't want to go as far as to say it's a quality vs. quantity sort of thing, but in ways that's what it feels like.  we'll pick up where we left off.  feeling: decompressed thinking of: the phone music: 'untitled' social distortion         ",male

"       During these two last days, another 23 Palestinians were killed, whereas 11 Israeli soldiers suffered the same fate, and there's really no end to the cruelties taking place in the Middle East.  I know this isn't exactly the PC thing to say, but really; he who expects the world community to find a solution to the regional crisis, is both badly misinformed and mistaken. The Temple mount is just as important to the Palestinians as it is to the Israelis. It is in other words imperative that both parties give up their religions in order to bring about peace to the Middle East - and we all know how realistic that is, don't we.  I'm not saying that the world leaders' efforts for peace aren't commendable, but they're hopelessly futile all the same. There's little else for the rest of us to do than to watch the Moslems and the Jews exterminate one-another day by day. With a little luck, statistics will show that more Palestinians and Israelis are born than killed, which of course is only good for prolonging the conflict considerably.  Of course this is my personal view on the matter, which is not to say that I'm dead against peace on earth and all that. But sometimes it helps to be realistic. I find that to be a most effective cure against the inevitable disappointments following (too) high expectations.         ",male

First of all, her first mistake was being a conservative. girls...if you are a woman, NEVER FUCKING BE CONSERVATIVE!!!!!!! iTS SELF DESTRUCTIVE DAMMIT!!!!1111!!!!!!!11    here is why: 1: Conservatives are against change and rights and fluffy things like that soo right off the bat you women are being abused 2: 99.99999 % of Conservatives are fundamentalist christian. do you know what that means? following the bible 100% of the time. This means that all you women must always bow down to your husbands wishes no matter what he says cuz god says so. sounds fun eh? 3. Conservatives are bitches when they are women and everybody hates them.  ::deep breath:: alright now to break apart that stupid bitches arguments. 'i think O.S.H.A. sucks cuz they are nitpicky.' ok good thinking lady. yes they are nitpicky at times.  but would you mind fucking thinking about what you are saying? we are in a recession lady! dont you fucking realize that the government has to cover their damn ass cuz all you fucking conservatives are trial lawyers and suing for bullshit like 'that dentist forgot to wear a rubber glove and i got a cold. GIMME 100 million dollars!!!1!!11' right so i won that argument you stupid whore. Next, she said something about how big lobbying corporations are made up of voters so bribing people is ok. wow you are a stupid bitch. Do you honestly think that UPS when they pushed to pass legislation that would make their employees work longer asked their people if they approved? they certainly didnt ask the guys who have to drive the brown trucks to give shit to rich people (like me). o but wait those cool black dudes in the brown suits are VOTERS so its ok. god damn i wanna kill people like you. well, not really.         everything in this rant obviously from the very ignorant standpoint of someone who did not work on capitol hill for 7 years. hats off to you lady. but your still a stupid conservative bitch.

"           8:45 am............... My dad shakes my foot and tells me someone is on the phone talking about a trip to Pheonix, the man with the master plan is  urlLink Andy , greetings were taken and the question was ' are you ready?'..........................NOPE. I needed about 20 minutes to get ready and 20 minutes it was, a race against the clock ensued, a quick shower and a stroke of deorderant and we were on our way. A slight detour was in progress when we decided we needed to ingest in some donuts from the infamous Dunkin donuts, hot cocoa or coco as I would put it burned my sensitive tongue and the journey was on. 5 minutes into the drive I had already spilled some damn hot coco on my gear and burned my hand with the searing liquid, Andy, the man with the plan and the mouth of steel gulped his piping hot goodness in easy strides. The road was calling our names and we were speeding toward it, eagerly anticipating the events ahead. First stop.... food and an inerstate 'subway' was grabbing our thoughts and we participated in good humor, a few trucker jokes and a hot 'subway' employee later we were back on the road as JK would say. Later a game of ' who can make the most truckers honk by pumping their fists in the air' began and at last count Andy was up by one truck, I was down for the count untill a truck weighing station showed her face to me and the trucks honked in my favor. One last stop before our final destination, a restroom break in the mother of all truck stops, they sold everything from candy to cd players, they even had an arcade room where I had to stop off and try my luck, after a few games of video hunting and a handfull of  urlLink hillbilly  jokes, the road had us. The last stop was of course the great town of Pheonix, Arizona, I loved it as soon as I caught a good glimpse, traffic was insane but tolerable since I wasn't driving, we met the lovely ladies that were letting us sleep on they're floor shortly after at one of the coolest apartments I've ever seen. After a warm greeting and a couple of dogs we were on our way to see the town and head for the reason we traveled so far. A slow trip to a rockin record store and a quick trip to a convienence store and we were on our way to glory and some just plain old rockin and rollin. The Nile Theater 7:30 pm, the presence of 'EMO' and all of her stupidity was present as we looked for parking, the walk to the club was like none I've ever taken, I was just about to see  urlLink Hey Mer  and I was giddy with anticipation. The place was packed with black rimmed glasses, beatle hair cuts, tight pants and the worst part, I saw a few geeks wearing the're very own, home -made Saves the Day shirts, frankly I wanted to punch every last one of them.........but I digress. The first band showed their faces and I expected the worst noise ever to come out of the pa but boy was I wrong,  urlLink Thursday  showed me a thing or 2. Slow ballads laced with cruchy guitars and some serious drum work was the making of this band, besides the sometimes cheesy mic spin and the Cedric-esk dance moves, they ripped! The moment I and probably 3 other people were waiting for, yep you guessed it Hey Mercedes took the stage, the opening chords to 'Frowning of a Lifetime' reared it's head and I began to sway, the band hunched over with the force of music and I hunched along, singing every word and slapping the drum beats on my thighs I was in semi-heaven. The following songs would consist of 85% new record and the rest old, every song put me into a dreamy state while Bob shook his head to the beat of the song, watching them play made me see that they are insanely great musicians and they made it look effortless, Damon has to be by far the greatest drummer I've had the privalage of seeing, not only did he rip it up for Hey Mer but he pulled double duty and rocked it with Saves the Day. With my fist occasionally in the air and the words constantly in my mouth I shuffled my feet and slapped my thighs for one of the greatest sets in history, they blurred the line between humans and God. After the set I parted ways with Hey Mer, hopefully not for the last time. 9:30... Saves the Day takes the stage and the crowd loses it, I'm not to enthused to see them on the basis that they have idiots for fans and the whole time before they came on I could here them talking shit about they other bands, thats just not kosher where I'm from. As usual STD as the idiots called them by their handcrafted crap shirts rocked it, played some of my favorites and a lot of songs off the new record but all in all they ripped as well, not as rockin as some other band that played called Hey Mercedes but it was good. Vicky and Valerie knew the happs on a little after show hangout and we stopped by for a little look at what too much pot and too much beer can do to a person, 'The Flying V's'(Vicky and Valerie) had a few things to do in the morning so the stay in the crack house was abruptly ended and the coronas were tapped, the buzz came to me in a cigarett and hunger induced shock. An air mattress, a dog bitting my hair, and a few hours of sleep. Day 2 involved a late breakfast early lunch, brunch if you will at a place called ' The Cheba Hut' which was a Marijuana themed samach place that had the names of pot for the names of their samacha's. The food was rockin and I want to go back right now, a stroll in the shopping section of town was induced and my love of the town grew, I was a little sad to leave but I will return one day, so Pheonix I hope your ready for me and my crew.   We have a new record out called 'Everynight Fireworks' and this songs not on it............  Bob Nanna         ",male

"       AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!  Let's just say that I am really, really pissed off right now.  Why? because my dad is being an ass right now and I really don't know what is up his butt.  It began a few weeks ago when he told me my hair was too long and that I needed to get it cut.  After some negotiating we came to an agreement that I would cut my hair.  Today I went in to have my hair cut.  Lorenne cut my hair very well and to my exact specifications.  Toward the end of the hair cut who do you suppose came striding through the door? My dad. He looked at my hair, told me it was still too long, and told me he wouldn't pay unless she cut more off.  He knew full well I had no money.  She cut it off.  He butchered it.  He is pretending like nothing happened and I am restraining myself from screaming vulgarness at him.  My self control is very low right now, which doesn't happen very often, and if he says anything more to me I really think I could kill him.         ",male
       ok so most of you know that my fave color is pink and how i wear it every day basically i'm kind of obsessedd with it(along with usher!)  well anyway pink is my thing and every since i started wearing it alot of people at my school are trying to do the pink thing. and they so can't couse it's my thing! Like shavan for instance is always wearing pink EVERYDAY. She's totally copying me. THat drives me off the wall. If i was trying to start a new trend it would be really cool. but i'm not. I'm the orignal. and soon nobody will think of me as the person that wears pink but as somebody that goes with flow. and i so don't.     Samie    ,female

"           It's no secret that a lot of people have been trying to get into Exun these past few days because of an unexplained surge in publicity. We've decided that we will state in a lucid manner what we are looking for and what we are not looking for. This log entry shall get a permanent link on the sidebar so that we can easily point people to it. Let me get to the point now.  We want members in the following categories:      Senior Quizzing (Class X to XII)     Debating, Declamation & Group Discussion (Public Speaking - Class IX to XII)     Software Display (Programmers in VC++, VB  who have made some kind of software )     Junior Programming (Class VI to VIII, knowledge of QBASIC)     Senior Programming (Class X to XII) applicants   please read:  We have many good senior programmers in Exun already and quite frankly we're saturated at the moment. Our priority right now is to send the existing programmers for events and competitions. Taking new programmers at this stage will do nobody any good. You may still apply for Senior Programming but be assured that unless you're really brilliant, your chances of getting in are low.   Junior Programming  Since QBASIC is no longer taught at Class VIII level (instead Visual Basic is taught), the Programming Department of Exun is planning to conduct a Logic Test for Class VIII very soon, from which promising students will be trained in QBASIC.   Software Display  Students who have made software in Visual Basic or Visual C++ (any software with a GUI) are invited to come and show their software to us (see below). We're looking for good software that can be sent for Software Display competitions.   Senior Quizzing  The toughest amongst them all. Hop along if you think you know about computers and we'll test you (see below).    Other categories  are:      Digital Imaging     Flash Animation     Web Designing    For these three, students are expected to bring a piece (or pieces) of original work and show it to us. We can judge you then. Again, see below.   See belows  Wherever See Below has been mentioned: Exun members are present in the eGurucool Lab (F-Block) during Break time everyday. Look for the Presidents (Maanick Nangia or Karan Misra) and if you can't find them, try to locate Mr. Mukesh Kumar.

"       A lot of stuff going around here these days... mainly on the job front...but also on other avenues..... have had to make a gut-wrenching decision this week...hope it turns out OK in the end... will update with more details later...... cannot let these times go unchronicled ofcourse ! ... but it is not time yet to put stuff in writing.... hmm...  this week was fun..went camping to the LA National forest.  Long winding route...absolutely breathtakingly sexy! As usual the plan was made at the last second :-) ...its always so with me and Hem. Another friend accompanied us...Priya....rented a car by 8:30 P.M., had a quick dinner and left for the park...had no frigging idea where it was...(coz we had initially thought of going to Santa Barbara...but that plan was changed at the last minute to the next day..!)..called up a friend on the phone..took vague directions on the route..and set forth. the drive was good...and driving on long winding routes at night is also fun  Lot of scenic spots on the way..got down at a couple of them....it was already cold by then..what i remember was the full moon..it was a striking gold in color....yeah..gold...hadnt seen anything like it before...ofcourse..dear old  urlLink hemchandra  brought it to my attention....and oh yeah he also mentioned seeing 2 shooting stars in the span of less than a minute..i seriously doubt it :-) Too bad the camera wasnt working that night..(hmm... a thought ... was that on purpose :-)  Well, then we reached the camping site at about 1:30 A.M. Set up the tent in less than 15 minutes..lit the fire..aaaahhh the warmth :-)stayed up around the fire..sipping vodka and a bit of good ol' scotch...not JD... And ofcourse there was the episode with the chicken..we had a few raw chicken legs that we had planned to roast..but couldnt gather enough decent sticks to hook the chicken and hold them over the fire...anyways, after a lot of trial and error we did manage something ....'burnt chicken' with alcohol for sauce..haha....that was fun.... slept at 5 or so....got up at 8..and left the camping site at about 9:30 A.M. this was my first camping trip inthe US.. Guess I should have done this a lot before :-)  Slept through the afternoon...went on a trip to Santa Barbara in the evening :-).. Next day saw another Desi movie..' urlLink Yuva ' this time..I liked this movie..Mani Ratnam hai...so it was bound to be different....had heard mixed reviews about this one...but i guess this was one of the better Hindi phillums I have seen in a while. Also had lunch (lunjj!!! haha....reminds me of EC back at RAIT!) at an Udipi joint at Artesia....Mazaa aa gaya ..life ban gaya....hogged beyond all limits   It sure helps when u have a girl for company....Considering all the trade-offs..its better on the whole i have learnt !   The next day...June 9th..was busy too....got a call from a consultant..the offer seemed quite good...am waiting for the offer letter in mail..had a talk with a few ppl...most say its too early to move to a consultant...even my EAD card hasnt arrived yet....am giving it a lot of thought...guess I will have to pull this consultant thing as long as I can....keep him on the tenterhooks till I can decide for sure...  Went to San Diego yesterday... urlLink Anil  had an interview..and I had a free ride....have been to San Diego too many times already..hell I know SD downtown better than LA now! although I must say..SD is a thousand times better than LA (personal opinion!)   Last week (June 8th) was also Grand Dad's 84th birthday...wow..thats an achievement in itself...and I bet he is healthier than me even now...Here's to you M. Back home in India, they had a big feast..more than 150 ppl turned up I guess..that is huuge :-) A very esoteric and cosmopolitan crowd, Sudha tells me :-) Ofcourse that was expected..having spent a major part of his life in bombay and Africa....besides Kerala.   I hope Dad has taken a few pics.....  WOW.... this post was big ! ....hopefully I will be a bit more regular henceforth....ofcourse absolutely no guarentees:-)!         ",male

I usually charm my way into their hearts at some point, but she stayed cold and unforgiving and I felt like I completely fucked up.  She didn't like that I just got out of school.  She didn't like that I couldn't pick a favorite brand quickly, or determine their target audience and why, and their competitors' target audiences and why, and the overall theme of the brand and the themes of its competitors and taking everything I said into consideration make up a commercial that fits into the paradigm I have created for the brand and its competitors where the key qualities that make my brand different from the others stand out while reinforcing the general qualities that help define my brand in the marketplace without alluding to any of the other brands key qualities that I believe make them different from my brand.  Yeah.  That interview was FUCKING hard.  And I got a second.  INSANE!!!!!!!!  Wow, I'm still reeling.  I was so crushed by this interview.  I was convinced that I was going to have to enter advertising from another way since the direct way didn't seem to be working.  Wow.

"       dude, what a day  i've been in a weird mood for most all of it... various and sundry reasons, but overall, i think i just woke up in a funk, nothing today really snapped me out of it, and thus i'm still in a funk... perhaps tomorrow i'll be cheerier.  significant events  * this morning at church pastor j announced that when he gets to his 65th birthday (this november) he's retiring... when he finished and his wife talked for a minute, the congregation gave them an ovation... the thing is, he's such a gifted and versatile preacher/pastor that he'll be greatly missed... he's been in the congregation here 27 years... i've just been attending there since september and  i'll  miss him a lot... but like he said, in light of that, we still have 10 months to rejoice together as the next steps for the congregation are taken... it'll be interesting to be sure.... i'm not sure exactly what the words are to my reaction to this, but yeah, the end.  * small confrontation w/ the roommate... it's even on a seemingly silly topic...  we were discussing some bills / other apartment stuff and she throws in 'by the way, i get migraines and you light scented candles... can you keep the door shut when you do that?'  a perfectly acceptable complaint, and i plan to respect it... the reason it even makes the blog is, 99% of the time when i have candles lit, my door  is  shut... she complained because last night i left my door open when i went out for an hour; i had just extinguished them when i headed out and my room still smelled like vanilla pecan... fine, fair enough... but why is it ok that she had like 5 scented candles lit in the tv room last night too but my candles aren't ok?  just confused by the double standard because if scented candles are the problem, she shouldn't be lighting them for herself too... oh well.  i don't think i'll ever understand her really, just try to get along.  * worked on analysis for a bit... figured out 1 problem last night, couldn't get the other one on my own, or working with eric in the office, so i called up jared, we went to his place and he explained all.,.. immediately after that we went to colleen's to work on lie groups... i got next to nothing out of that since colleen and leigh have been discussing it all weekend and i've been elsewhere so they were at a different point than me in reading/working, plus the style they were attacking it with wasn't working for me... good for them, just yeah, i left feeling like i had accomplished nothing in the previous 4 hours, and still in a funk  *following me giving up on lie groups for the evening, eric and i argued for at least half an hour about how to read star maps and where in the sky we saw the meteor last night... not heated, just both convinced we were right and the other was confused... it more or less ended with  eric: 'and now i could just make a sweeping sexist comment' me: 'except it won't apply here, so you won't' eric: 'because you don't count as a girl?' me: 'that and because i DO have a good sense of direction' etc.  it's all a list of little piddly not-a-big-deal things, but i'm tired, and tired of people for the night.    reading, then sleeping off my attitude... night all.

Well I'm looking at this as way to try and clear my head of all the shit that's floating around in it, hopefully letting me sleep easier at night. And hopefully without too many typos. It'll be something for people I know to see how fucked in the head I was after I'm gone. I'd better remember to do a will and put a mention of this in it... it's not much good otherwise.  Well for a first post I might as well talk about what has been happening that inspired(?) me to start this thing. Every now and then I get depressed, and to varying degrees and in slightly different ways.  Sometimes I'll just get what I'll call 'apathy depressed' - a bit depressed and not really caring about shit, couldn't be bothered, just want to be left the fuck alone. In reality it's probably best that I go and do something with some friends, something to get me out of the house and socialising. But that is a lot easier said than done. What am I going to do, ring up my mates and say 'Fellas, I'm feeling depressed. Let's go and do  (insert some crap here ) '?  Not fucken likely... instead I'm going to sit around the house hoping my housemate isn't home so I can feel miserable my myself, maybe hide out in my room because I'm too fucken embarassed and don't want people to see how fucked in the head I am. Nobody wants to hear my shit. Nobody wants to know you're a fruitloop. That's why I'm doing this blog for fuck's sake. At least it's like I'm telling someone without them feeling awkward and wishing I'd never opened my mouth to tell them.  Other times I'll call it 'angry depressed' - worse than don't care, I hate not only myself but everything and everyone else for making me feel like that, even though really it is my own fucked up fault. Nobody has done shit to me. But still I want to take it out on someone, something,  anything . I feel like driving my car head-on into a truck. I want to walk into a mosque with a big knife and yell 'Hey you fucked up gang rapists, I'm here to cut your dicks off!'. I want to walk down the mall in Cabramatta yelling 'All you slanty eyed boat people fuck off and sell your heroin in your own country!'. I want someone or something to kill me so I don't have to do it myself. That would fuck up my family's heads, especially my little brother. Fuck, if it wasn't for him I would've been gone long ago.  So instead, I'll try to make up for the 'mental' pain with some physical pain - not necessarily with a knife, though I have. If I've got sore joints, I'll give them a thrashing at the gym so they hurt more. Last time my knees were giving me a dull ache constantly, so I would go walking for hours at a time until they  really fucken hurt .  When the depression is at it worst I've noticed it goes through stages, no matter how much I try to think and do shit otherwise to try and stop the fucked up thoughts and feelings. I think there's some chemical deficiency in my brain or some shit. I'll get to that some time.  The best way I can think to describe the worst of it is like falling off a cliff. One moment I'm feeling great, things are going good, I'm loving life. Blah blah blah. Then all it takes is one thing I didn't want to happen, one bad thought to enter my head - and its like slipping on the edge of a cliff as you are about to take a photo from the top.  And the higher the cliff, the longer the fall, and the deeper valley below. And once you land and look around, thinking about how far you have fallen and how much it hurts, you really start to wonder it if is worth trying to climb all the way back up that fucken cliff again. Shit, just getting back up to normal ground where you started will be enough of a struggle and take enough time, let alone going for the top again. Let's just stop it all right now. You're at the bottom. Everything sucks. Every time you try to climb up there it just all ends in tears. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. Why bother? You see other people around you climb up but you can't. Seems as soon as you get out of this shithole, you fall back in. Why, why, why can't I get out of this shit? Even just stay on level ground? Why am I so fucked up?  This is usually the angry depression, and it's the worst. It usually takes a few days up to a week to get through this. Seems no matter what I do or try to think I just can't get out. As soon as I have a spare moment when I'm not trying to concentrate on some task at hand, BANG!, it's right there. And it does get hard to concentrate. You get 2-3 hours sleep a night because :   (A) you can't get to sleep to start with because your mind is busying thinking about the shit making you depressed and how much you wished you were normal;   (B) once you fall sleep you keep having dreams like cutting your legs off or killing the next stranger you see walking down the street;   (C) you're awake now and back to (A).     When you are awake you are full of 'angry energy' - you are so angry you can't stop grinding your teeth, tapping your feet, hitting the desk, pacing back and forth, clenching your fists, etc. Ready to explode. Screw Yoda, if you could use The Force you could destroy whole fucken planets, forget needing the Death Star. You wish you could spontaneously combust. Get this shit over with. I'm over it.    Slowly I'll seem to change from 'angry' to 'apathy'. I'll still have that energy. Kill myself yes, but not anyone else. I'll wake up in the morning and think 'Oh great, another shitty day in my shitty life. Why the hell do I bother? It'd be much easier to just skol a bottle of vodka and end it.' Or drive my car under a truck. Or overdose on heroin. Or blow my brains out. Or jump off a building.    So I'll be at work, trying to concentrate but can't stop thinking 'You're fucked up. You'll never fix your head. End it. Do the world a favour.' Then I start thinking about my funeral. Would they bother telling anyone? If they did, would anyone come? How many people that I think are my friends would be there? Should I find out now?    Although I can write that there is one thing that will pull me up out of the valley like a bungie cord - the same thing that got me to the top of the cliff. But does that happen? No. Why do you think I 'slipped' in the first place?            ",male
"             Well friends, another year has come and gone.&nbsp; We are amazed at how God continues to bless us.&nbsp; This has been a year full of ups and downs for us and we'd like to share them with you.   Collin  started the year in preschool. He absolutely loved it and finished in May.&nbsp; His class delighted us all at the closing program by acting out the classic kid's story, Caps for Sale.&nbsp; His Uncle Jef and Aunt Lisa gave him this book for Christmas a couple of years ago and it is a family favorite.&nbsp; He started  urlLink Kindergarten  this fall is having a great time.&nbsp; His teacher says that he is a charmer and popular with the other children, although he sometimes allows socializing to get in the way of doing his work.&nbsp; He is looking forward to being on TV in January - he gets to say the menu of the day on one of the local morning news programs!     urlLink     Leslie  is potty trained, charming and is starting preschool in January.&nbsp; I have thoroughly enjoyed having her to myself when Collin is in school.&nbsp; She is starting to be a real chatter bug, which was surprising to us.&nbsp; I guess she never has a chance to get much in until Collin is gone!&nbsp; She is a very considerate child for the most part and we are looking forward to seeing what she becomes.    Jason  has a full year. He began a new job about this time last year for World Health Systems as an office manager and although he enjoyed his job there, he really missed being in the OR.&nbsp; Faced with a rent hike and high cost of living, we decided to move to Kansas where we could make ends meet with less stress and Jason could pursue his love of medicine.&nbsp; He is now enjoying his job in the operating room at  urlLink Via Christi  here in Wichita.&nbsp; Beginning in January, he'll be taking classes toward his nursing degree.   And I was blessed to have the opportunity to do a great deal of theatre last year!&nbsp; I designed and ran lights for  urlLink Rochester Church of Christ 's Christmas show and stage managed  urlLink Rochester College 's big show, Celebration in Song, in March.&nbsp; I also got to direct an incredibly talented group of actors in People Like Us, RCC's summer show in July.&nbsp; Now that we are in Kansas, I'm not sure what I'll be doing theatre-wise, but God always provides something.&nbsp; I'm eager to see what it will be!&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy my job as mom every day.   Our extended family has added 3 babies this year!&nbsp; We welcomed Kyra King, Mollie Grace McLeod, and  urlLink Daniel Rutledge  in 2001.&nbsp; We are delighted to see our family growing.   The future is looking rosy for us as we are considering being cottage parents at a local children's home,  urlLink Maude Carpenter .&nbsp; This looks like a marvelous opportunity for all four of us and we are praying for God's leadership as we begin to make this choice.

"                 hey ya'll.  that's right i said ya'll.  i haven't updated my blog for real in a couple weeks.  and in those couple of weeks i went country.  just kidding ;)  well i won't bore you with details from the last couple of weeks.   lemme start with stacey.  homegirl is sick.  i dunno how those doctors fucked up her meds again, but she got herself in the emergency room last sunday.  now on friday she got moved to isolation because the fluid and bacteria from her lungs moved to her stomach.  bah!!!  i miss my lumploaf and even though she said butthumping is prohibitted in the hospital, i think i'm gonna find a way around that. ;)  so now let's start with tuesday.  tuesday started out a good day.  until i got a msg from sarah telling me to check my e-mail.  that's where it all went downhill.  all the servers received a 'motivational' email from mike langsner aka the evil jew or ej for short.  so after reading it, i exploded.  then i forwarded it to nia, and she too blacked out.  i think we both put new meaning into that phrase on tuesday.  said blackout was followed by hours of writing our i quit emails.  nia sent hers out a day before me.  she got a nice response.  i sent mine out the next day, i got an evil response from EJ.  long story short, i no longer work there.  he responded to me quitting by firing me.  but, i had already quit.  don't think you got the last word EJ, cause i did!!!  friday my mood greatly improved because me and joseph headed up to new york a day earlier then everyone else.  we wanted to do some sightseeing.  right.  we didn't leave the room until it was time to eat.  saturday we movtivated ourselves to go to toyrus though.  plus we were hungry again.  we had fun in there and the ferris wheel was good even though we got stuck on the stupid pokemon car.  i actually took pictures where joseph looked normal much to my surprise.  then later that day beth and david arrived.  we went down to the lobby to meet them, and joseph's sweater was on inside out, i have no idea why!! :)   hehe.  ok so new york was good.  we had the best  dinner ever.  a place called tello's.  i can still taste that  sauce.  so good.  then we met up with everyone at no idea.  no really, that was the name of the bar.  there was enough vodka in my drink to stun a horse.  that's when i knew the night was gonna be good.  then we all headed out to culture club.  now i thought that going to an 80s club would be funny, and man was i right.  right off the bat sarah fell up the stairs holding her 12 dollar redbull and vodka.  it was the funniest thing i've ever seen.  it  was like a slow motion fall.  the greatest part was when her  chest hit and her drink splashed up into her face.  like joseph said, if he had caught it on tape, he would be a millionaire.  we left around 1ish cause i was tired and so was he.  we went right to sleep when he got back.  no joke.  and then sunday morning i watched my girl while joseph scrounged for food and then we peaced out with michael and nia.  another funny moment was michael standing at the train door waiting for it to automatically open.  which it doesn't.  then joseph, the last in line, got caught in the door as the train was pulling away cause michael waited so long!!!  hahaha, good times.  for me atleast ;)                   ",female

"       I embrace this day with enthusiasm as spring has finally decided to visit Bavaria.  Normally I do not allow the weather to rule my emotions, however after an 8 month long winter I was begining to question the meaning of life.  Yesterday a parka. Today, sundress, sandals and light sweater.  I promised myself that tomorrow I will pound out the first chapter of Titty Bar Metaphysics, a spiritual comedy about Reiki Strippers healing the Universe with love, light and nudity. It just occurred to me that if I took my clothes off I could evacuate half of Central Europe.  'Large, white pasty buttocks were responsible for half of Europe's departure for the sunny beaches of Spain today'  German's have tans even in winter.  I guess I could go to the electric beach for a little fake & bake to obtain that healthy glow. hum, the pale & pasty is actually the healthier choice. Have sun screen will travel 12 paces to my balcony as the Englisher Garten is not an option today.  The site of me could do permanent damage to unsuspecting tourist. I shall fine tune my procrastination skills to the sound of chirping birds and my own skin roasting beneath the Bavarian sky.         ",female
"             How annoying.  I just lost a couple paragraphs when I did something (I don't know what) on the keyboard.  Back to what I was saying, paraphrased of course.  Yesterday was Opening Day of baseball season.  I now know that because of my husband.  Until I met him, I would never have watched a game on TV much less gone to one in person.  But my husband's family is a big baseball family, and I don't just mean big fans.  His uncle played for the Yankees in the late 1930's and early 1940's (with Joe Dimaggio, Yogi Berra and Lou Gherig to name a few).  Bill's dad played for the Washington Senators and when the team moved to Texas he moved right along with them and went into the management end of things.  So when I first started dating Bill and his folks would tell stories (and they  love  to tell stories) it took me a while to catch on that Ted, who was so mad he stormed out of the hotel room and into a closet, was Ted  Williams .    Now I'm a baseball fan.  I can keep score and do it better than anyone else in his family (they never keep track of balls and strikes).  I also can tell you if it was a 6-4-3 or a 5-4-3 double play and know the seven ways to get on base.  Go figure.   Happy Birthday Baby Boy!  It's my little guy's birthday.  He's one and so cute.

Well, i've still got some planning to do, but me and my co-artist guy have made some tiles and put them together to form a mock-up shot of what the game is going to look like.  We have two objects here, a crate and a barrel. The crate is pushed in 4 directions, up, down, left, and right. The barrel is only pushed in two directions, and when pushed it will roll untill something stops it. Also, when pushed into water, the barrel will float and create a platform for crossing.

"   Today was my first full day back to work after a three-week medical leave.  WOW!  To experience being productive, useful and purposeful again was staggering.  To finally feel like I’ve healed enough that my broken brain isn’t dictating and consuming all of my existence.  Beginning the process of starting my “new” normalcy.  And yes, I’m purposefully not using the control word--or saying I’m back in control--because I believe that control is an illusion in life.  I simply try to make the best decisions I can with what life presents me with.  I’m a much happier person with this philosophy.  I’ve also been having tons of fun rediscovering my independence.  I’m not ashamed to admit how much fear I had traveling all by myself yesterday.  Yesterday was the first time I’ve been on my own since my brain broke--with no one to lean on “Just in case.”  I acknowledged my fear, turned it over to whatever is greater than I, and had a excellent time traveling alone.  And although, I’m missing my Turtle desperately (already), I think these 5 days, standing alone on my own two feet, is going to help my psyche immensely.    My feelings are still whirling when I think back over my day today.  I drove. I worked. I fed myself. I took care of myself.  I’ll give myself my injection.  Woo hoo….I’m starting to be a living, breathing, functioning human being again.  And just three weeks again, I couldn’t even dial a telephone to wish my nephew happy birthday.  Wow, what a difference a day makes to quote a horrible cliché.  It’s almost been as cool as when I turned 21 and was could marvel in the fact that I was officially an adult.  Today’s Happy Accident to celebrate:  Rediscovering my independence, like an 18-year-old all over again!  ",female

"             Chris & I saw Van Helsing, after drinks & some appetizers.  I liked it for the special effects, but don’t expect great things from it.  The story line is a little weak.  I think the most awesome part was when these guys would turn into werewolves.  They would rip off their skin and their bones would start moving and shifting - it was really cool!  I also liked the vampire brides and how they would immediately change into these gorgeous women as soon as they touched the ground.  I'd recommend going to see it, but again, don't expect great things.   I haven’t bought my Mom a Mother’s Day gift yet but her birthday is the 17th, so I’m planning to send something halfway between for both events.  I know that’s kind of lame and lazy but that’s how things get done around my house.  Lame & Lazy.  If I had a ranch, I’d have to call it L & L Dude Rand and stock it with hot guys who walk around bare-chested all day long while they lift heavy things so that they sweat & then they’ll need me to rub their shoulders after their doneeeeee – sorry, I was drooling on my keyboard.  I’m going to have to come back to this subject after work!  My thoughts keep getting away from me and then I wake up only to have my coworkers staring at me strangely too afraid to ask questions.  Well, Chris is graduating from his Level 1 improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade.  His show is this Sunday at 4 pm.  I can’t wait to see my baby perform!!  I’m thinking about making a t-shirt with a picture of him on it and that says something stupid (read: embarrassing), but I’m going to have to think hard on this.  I may have to tap my sister, Bridget, for some ideas.  She’s a clever lass.   And for today’s random question:  What bones have you broken, if any?  And how did you break it?   Well, during the summer before 3rd grade, I was playing basketball on a concrete slab (that used to be our house before it burned) with 3 others.  I tripped and fell on my right arm.  It didn’t hurt until everyone started pointing at it & then it hurt like hell.  Long story short, I ended up in a full arm cast on my right arm.    A week after I finally got the cast off, I went over to my friend’s house to play.  We were climbing trees, doing cartwheels, running all over the place, etc.  Unfortunately, I tripped (again!) on my way into her playhouse & broke the same arm in the same place.  Luckily, since my Mom was still in the driveway talking to her Mom, she ushered me into the car wrapped my arm in ice and then we were on our way to Shreveport to get my arm set again.  And finally, in the 6th grade, I fractured my left arm during gym at school.  It was the first class of the day & we were playing dodgeball when, again, I tripped.  I made it through the day only to go home and beg my Dad to take me to the hospital cause it hurt so badly.  So there, that’s my 3 broken bones.  I won’t even get into the story of the 3 stitches I had in my head due to (once again) dodgeball.  Thought I was gonna say that I tripped again, didn’t ya?         ",female

"        The  Uygur Letter   is dedicated to the Uygur people of Xinjiang. It’s raison d’etre is to help promote world awareness of the Uygur and the situation they currently face in China.  If they are known at all, then they are known to a majority of people as just one of the 56 Ethnic groups in the world’s most populated nation. Their “claim to fame” is that they suffer human rights violations at the hands of a nation of people, whom predominantly are ethnically and culturally different to them.   Their story to many is very much a contemporary one, one of international politics, dissent, nationalism and human rights. A story of an indigenous people battling to maintain their culture and way of life in the face of a rolling juggernaut.  But the Uygur are more than that.  The Uygur have an incredible  history. They have an wonderful culture that has had an immense impact on Central Asia, China and the world. Their music and dance for example is both beautiful and passionate.   The Uygur people are enigmatic. They have a timelessness about them that one can not describe.  Like the wolves that figure prominently in their folklore, they have a presence that speaks of an unstated superiority in the scheme of things. It is not the “superiority” of say an American an Englishmen or a German. It is somehow different, it speaks of having seen it all and having survived, of waiting.  Over a period, depending on how news breaks, I would like to introduce you to them. Their history, their culture, where and how they live. I think it is important to put a face to the people.  Today I would like to talk very briefly of the early history from their days of nomadic roaming across Mongolia and southern Siberia through to their empire and eventual migration to what is now China.    The History.........   Uygur history has been played out on a stage that would try even the most inventive of fantasy writers in their attempt to recreate it. Towering snow caped mountain ranges, blistering deserts, rugged mountain passes and verdant oases. All in an area that is the farthest point from any ocean on our planet.   Add to this scenario marauding tribes of 'barbarian' nomads, battles and conflicts, in-fighting, historic trade routes and political intrigues at the highest office of some of the greatest empires and Dynasties in history, the Uygur were at the center of it all. Not only as bystanders but as active participants.  The influence of the Uygur on the history of central Asia is undoubted by any who know it; their influence on the history and culture of the world is grossly unacknowledged and underestimated.  For over two thousand years the Uygur have played a central role in the historical and cultural development of the central Asian region. Around the time of Christ the Uygur were emerging as a potent political, military and cultural force.   In constant battle or confederation with the numerous tribes of the region as well as the dynasties of the Han and Tang Chinese the Uygur grew into a great Central Asian empire. Their influence as concerns religion, literature, law making, diplomacy, industry and trade was immense.                            Compared to the Europeans of that time, the Uyghurs were far more advanced.                                 Albert von Lecoq                   The consequences of these experiences combined with their political and intellectual maturity would eventually, through their subsequent influence on the Mongols, have ramifications felt around the world and have a very real influence upon civilisation as we now know it.  Being at the very crossroads of two great cultures, East and West, the Uygurs acted as conduits for the transference of culture and tradegoods. Over the centuries they have been involved, one way or the other, in the intrigues, the strategic and political positioning of great religions, nations and empires.   The Chinese Dynasties, British and Russian Empires, the Soviets, the communist Chinese and lately the Americans all have wooed the Uygurs and just as many times betrayed them. Buddhism and Islam have both been championed by the Uygurs and their influence in the growth of these religions in both in Central Asia and China is very significant.  To a modern world, that knows little or nothing of them, claims as to the Uygur's global influence would come as a great surprise. However, in learning more about these unique people, surprise will give way to admiration of a people that for 2,000 years have defied great events and empires to develop a unique and wonderful culture in the very crucible of modern civilisation.   A people who have, to this date, over 2,000 years, maintained their cultural an ethnic identity in the face of immense military and political powers and pressures.   Ab Initio: Rise and Supremacy    The tribes and clans that would eventually become known as the Uygur rose in Mongolia and Southern Siberia and were first mentioned in Han Dynasty histories in the first century BCE.  There is hypothesis that the Uygur were descendants of the Hun, however this does not seem to be proven. Chinese records would indicate that they can definitely be traced back to the Dingling nomadic tribe that roamed north and north western present day China and in areas south of Lake Baykal (south central Siberia) and between the Intush River and Lake Balkush.  In 744 CE the Uygurs threw off the yoke of the then ruling  Go Turk   tribes and under ruler  Khutlugh Bilge Kul Khagan  (Khagan meaning Ruler/King) founded the first true state constituted under the name Uygur.  The Uygurs commenced the building of this empire by subjugation of other Turkic tribes of central Asia and eventually extended Uygur sovereignty north to Lake Bayakal, east to present day Gansu China and South west to present day India. The capital of the Uygur empire was established in Togabash on the banks of the Okhun River and their empire became known as the “Orkhun Uygur Empire”  As an example of their power and prestige in the years 755-757 The Tang Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom China were facing an internal rebellion and requested help from the militarily powerful Uygur to help quell it.   The Uygur successfully prosecuted several campaigns and eventually the Tang where triumphant. In reward they bestowed favourable trade terms on the Uygur as well as an annual Tribute measured in silk. The Chinese Emperor also gave his daughter as a bride to the Uygur Khagan and all told in the period 740 - 840 CE three Chinese Princesses would become Uygur  Khatuns  (Khagan’s wives)  The Uygur empire came to an end in 840 when the Kyrghiz, another Turkic tribe, brought the Uygur predominance to a close.  It was after their defeat at the hands of the Kryghiz that the Uygur migrated to the Tarim Basin area in what is now present day Xinjiang and to the now Gansu Province in China, areas that had formed part of their previous empire.

"             The office house negro, randomly known as the baby of the negro clique, has approximately 45 days left on the plantation before she heads down the underground railroad, with all signs pointing to Knoxville, Tennessee. You may say I'm heading in the direction of a far more racist and whip-tastic plantation but at least, the rednecks up there are up front and honest with their hatred for the 'cullured folk'. If you're a racist, proclaim it like the poor fellow I encountered on the expressway this morning. He was driving non other than the official transportation choice of Southun' rednecks, an F150, complete with a couple of choice state university emblems with racial undertones, a Nascar logo, a rebel flag and a personalized license plate that read...NBKILLER. Of course, the obvious translation of this is nigger boy killer. Its the only logical answer. If you can think of another, please inform me. 'Preciate it.  Today is my makeshift monday. Why?

I deserve it. I'm here bright and early with the uncle tom overseer, working for massa. So who cares if I sat peddling the stationary bike on the sidelines, nursing my injury, apparently with the inability to 'play hurt'.

They should have let me do it. Homeboy would have been suited and booted before he could say Rush Limbaugh.   So it looks like I'm leaving before he does and that majorly sucks.

"       i was just reading what i wrote in my journal 2am sunday (after getting back from going out) and i can't figure out why i felt the need to write anything in my drunken state.  it's very hard to read...  we (becky, her brother alex, and i) went to see a double feature of spiderman and men in black 2 saturday evening, and afterwards we went to the hill street cafe which is really a bar but it's called a cafe.  the music was decent (there was one of those touch screen juke box thingys there and most people didn't play suckage although there was an awful lot of grateful dead) and the fries with gravy were excellent as far as i could tell (but i was drunk by the time they got to us).  i think i was the only one of the three of us that got drunk 'cause i was drinking gin and tonics and they were drinking beers...  anyway, so when i got home i guess i felt the need to recap the evening in my journal, and the writing is just too funny.  i rant for like a page and a half over how awful kirstun dunst looked in spiderman and how if i were her i'd kill the hair/makeup person.  i mean, really, she had no upper lip in most of the scenes.  and the shade of red was all wrong for her skintone, she just looked sick.  when i brought this up to beck and her brother alex said that she was supposed to look girl-next-door and not over the top hot.  yeah.  well.  girl-next-door shouldn't mean sick looking with no upper lip and constantly squinting.  my other writings from that night are about this couple who was sitting across from us at the bar.  they were kind of dressed the same: jeans and white shirts, and the girl was all over the guy.  she was on his lap at one point.  then some fat guy came over and started talking to the guy and the girl seemed to lose interest...  we couldn't believe the guy didn't just tell the fat guy to go away.  then later when the girl was back on his lap again the fat guy asked the guy if he could sit on his lap too..  the couple left shortly after that (although we were speculating that the guy waited too long and now the girl was just going to pass out).  i went to sleep then, but everytime i woke up during the night i felt the need to write more...  it's kind of interesting watching my writing get more coherent as i sober up...

Went to bed early.  On Saturday morning, woke up around 9:30am or maybe t was later. After mimi went to work I drove up to school, but they wouldn't let me work - they said my time had expired and I was supposed to meet with one of the directors. He stood me up. So I called Alex, he was asleep. I went home and got on my computer and talked to Kevin from Shreveport. He convinced me to come out to veggie garden at 2pm to eat and hang out. I had no money( I do but my account is frozen until I get my money back and my rent paid) but Nick hooked me up and now I owe him lunch. I got home around 3:45 and Brian called.

We watched Pi - that was a kick ass movie. It made you think for sure.   I wanted to go dig for books behind the Half Price Books - it was 1am - mimi was tired.

"                 ...Our Program already in Progress:  Hello friends. I guess this first of all posts should begin with a little about myself. That's easy, the name's Travis. I'm 21, on the brink of 22-dom. I currently reside in the DC area. I've been here for about a month and I think I'll keep it. I'm an engineer and I'm gay. I stand by my opinion that gay engineers make cool engineers, whereas straight engineers make dorks...  That's not meant as a dig to any of you. Making fun of others just makes you feel better about yourself. No seriously... There are some kickass not-completely-devoid-of-social-skills engineers out there. Of the 14 on the east coast... I'm friends with 12.   A little background, you ask? Okay... Born and bred in suburban Connecticut. Had your normal childhood. Shitty at times, lovely the next day. I just had that one thing that made me a little different than all my friends. That one thing that I couldn't talk about for most of my life. But then don't we all. I don't mean to depict my sexual orientation as a sob story by any means. We all have our trials and tribulations and are stronger/wiser for having experienced them. And don't get me wrong I had a loving supportive family, conservative and religious at the crux, but subsequently (and possibly hypocritically) supportive during my coming out.  I had two older siblings, the kind you love to hate, and hate to love, again typical. They are two of the most amazing people I know. I looked up to them so much in my life my neck is still sore. At times I couldn't stand them, at times they'd make me cry, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  And now on to my final family member, my secondary caretaker... TV. I have this long standing opinion that nearly everything I know I've learned from TV. If you yield the power of that beautiful glowing box for good, the world is your oyster. Well maybe not that much, but as Martha would say 'It's a good thing.' Early in my childhood I discovered (no not men, that came a little later), movies. Thank god I was born when I was, 'cause the VCR shaped my life. Look upon this as you wish, but I believe it was genuinely good  Whenever you talk to a gay person, well at least most of the time. They always say, 'I always new I was different.' Which is our way of saying even before I got erections from MTV's 'The Grind,' (Go Eric) I knew somethin' was up. So in order to escape those alienation feelings I entered what I have since dubbed 'my celluloid closet.' Was it healthy, maybe not, but it got me through a lot of years when I wasn't ready to face myself. People often wonder why they didn't know. To a certain extent so do I, but I sure as hell didn't want them to figure it out. Is this why there are so many homosexuals in Hollywood? Is it because we all grow up as actors? Well I played the part well. I didn't go as far as to submerse myself in athletics, but I have gotten to the point where I can't tell if things I like are mine, or my cover's. I'm like Charlie Baltimore in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight,' or am I Samantha Caine? Take music for one: Do I really like Metallica, or was that just my psyche trying to compensate my seemingly feminine 'condition' with more masculine characteristics? Well I am 1 year+ out of that closet, and this sort of self discovery is going to continue for a little while.   Maybe that's why I'm starting this... but I highly doubt it 'cause I predict that the majority of the posts will be of a random nature as an outlet for the funny that courses through my veins.

"                 I think I have officially run the gamut on films and novels involving consumption and have now moved on to poetry. I knew my collection of anthologies would come in handy on these rainy nights as I cough and cough.  In his modest room, a 25-year-old 'lapsed' medical student in 1820s Great Britain wakes from a sudden fevered sweat and finds a single drop of blood on the sheet. He has known many patients who spit such bright blood. “It’s arterial blood…that blood is my death warrant, I must die,” he confides to a friend. One of England’s greatest poets, the medical student John Keats, never wrote specifically about phthisis. But his life and his works became a metaphor for generations of patients, a metaphor that helped transform the physical disease 'phthisis” into its spiritual offspring, 'consumption.'   Keats’ life was defined by tuberculosis. At 14, he nursed his mother as she died of phthisis. A few years later he watched his brother die of phthisis, and by age 23, he had symptoms of this “hereditary' ailment himself. Yet, as the best remedies (bleeding, diet, red wine, opium) failed, as his work was savaged by critics and he was forced from the woman he loved (he could not marry because of the disease), Keats feverishly wrote his greatest poems: Ode to a Nightingale, Ode on a Grecian Urn, Ode on Melancholy.   He died only months after he first spit blood. Autopsy found his lungs completely destroyed. He was 26. To be dead himself within the year, Percy Bysshe Shelley, another young poet with phthisis, compared Keats to “a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,/And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew/The bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew/Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste;/The broken lily lies—the storm is overpast.”  Shelley’s tribute expressed what would become the central metaphor of consumption in the 19th century, the idea that the phthisic body is consumed from within by its passions, “the bloom…Died on the promise of the fruit.” Shelley also likened Keats to an eagle that “outsoared the shadow of our night,” and “could scale Heaven, and could nourish in the sun’s domain.” These romantic notions contrasted sharply with the actual demise of tuberculosis patients, poets or not. As death neared, Keats himself contradicted Shelley. In “On Seeing the Elgin Marbles” (published posthumously), Keats wrote, “My spirit is too weak—mortality/Weighs heavily upon me like unwilling sleep,/And each imagin’d pinnacle and steep/Of godlike hardship, tells me I must die/Like a sick Eagle looking at the sky.”  In succeeding decades, Keats’ illness came to exemplify the so-called spes phthisica, a condition believed peculiar to consumptives in which physical wasting led to euphoric flowering of the passionate and creative aspects of the soul. The prosaic human, it was said, became poetic as the body expired from consumption, genius bursting forth from the fevered combustion of ordinary talent, the body burning so that the creative soul could be released. Keats’ great poetic output during his last year was considered a direct consequence of consumption.   Spes phthisica, which sought to make sense of the senseless and give purpose to purposeless suffering and death, came to be viewed as a prerequisite for creative genius. French author Alexandre Dumas fils wrote, “It was the fashion to suffer from the lungs; everybody was consumptive, poets especially; it was good form to spit blood after any emotion that was at all sensational, and to die before reaching the age of thirty.” Dumas’ colleague, the poet Théophile Gautier, wrote, “…I could not have accepted as a lyrical poet anyone weighing more than ninety-nine pounds.” A subsequent alleged decline in the arts was even blamed on decline in tuberculosis incidence.

I put in the software to load the cam-drivers.  My monkey-box spun its little 2x CD-ROM drive, gave me a little song and dance about virus check and then boom...   NO USB PORT DETECTED   NO USB PORT?  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?  Everything has a USB port!  Oh, but it gets better.  I spin the monkey-box around and there are two USB ports just empty and looking at me.  How the HELL do I make these things active?  I may not blog for the rest of the afternoon because I'm going to open my computer and pour a bucket of water in it!  BAD MONKEY-BOX!

"                 obedience is the part of our relationship with Christ that sometimes prevents us from moving forward. is it possible that God plants ideas or notions on our hearts and minds and then removes that initial excitement to build the character that we need to follow through on His calling? this is not to say that i am not as excited as i can be about the prospects that lie ahead in full-time ministry; it is to say that God will allow you to be challenged. i will follow through on this calling. i keep hearing that i need to be patient. i know this, but i continue to allow my spirit to perpetuate a restless sensation. i want to serve, and i know that God has called me to do it full-time. who knows what is going to happen next week? who knows what is going to happen tomorrow. i just want my heart filled with Christ’s love, and if I don’t “feel” it there, i am going to act on it anyway, out of obedience.

"             Just some thoughts on the Western Conference as players sign with teams...here are my top eight teams...note the absence of the Lakers.  My number eight team is a tough call...Portland is talented, deep, but dysfunctional. Utah made a run this year and they've added Carlos Boozer.  They still seem to be short a few guards, but the most fun for that team will be watching Jerry Sloan break down the Uberegomaniac rookie, Kris Humphries.  New Orleans has moved to the West, but they haven't made any significant changes and everybody on that team is a year older, not better...I'm going with Memphis for this pick.  The Geriatric Geniuses, Jerry West and Hubie Brown, have a seemingly endless supply of solid players.  Ok, not endless, but they've got fifteen guys under contract right now and every one of them could step in and contribute.  They picked up Andre Emmett and will be able to take their time grooming him.  Their youth is developing and I can see West making a big splash in next year's FA pool by bringing in a couple of players.  Until then, Hubie will use his depth to win games by wearing teams down.  I give them the number eight seed in the playoffs.  Phoenix is a poor man's Dallas.  After picking up Nash, they're just as good from point guard to power forward as any team in the league...but there's a gaping hole at center, unless you consider Jake Voskuhl or Zarko Cabarkapa as legitimate centers.  The Suns will run as much as possible and will be great entertainment, but with their lack of size and defense will hurt them in the clutch.  I'm still trying to figure out why they signed Quentin Richardson, seeing as that position is already filled by Joe Johnson...leads me to think they may make a run at Eric Dampier and try to pull a sign and trade for Johnson somewhere down the road.  Denver is a hard team to get a read on for a few reasons.  Signing KMart will undoubtedly be a boost to their inside game (he's their future now, seeing as they gave up three first round draft picks to get him) and Carmelo and Nene will improve just from another year of experience.  However, three things come to mind that I think will define their season.  Can Camby duplicate last year's performance?  If he's healthy, there's no reason to think he can't.  Will playing in the Olympics hamper Carmelo?  He looked worn at times last year, so I can see this being a problem later in the season (i.e., draft him in your fantasy league, trade him at the break).  Will they be able to recapture the same chemistry they had last year?  They seem like a close group, so I'm guessing yes.  Andre Miller looked more comfortable in their system as the year went on, so I'm guessing he'll be able to pull them together and blend KMart into their system.  Last year Dallas payed Antawn Jamison $15 million to come off the bench.  Stop and read that sentence again.  In my opinion, the Mavs pulled off the second best trade of the summer just behind the Heat's coup by dumping that salary in exchange for a Stackhouse (an all-star if healthy), Laettner (who's in the final year of his contract, great trade bait), and the arguably most NBA ready rookie (Devin Harris).  Quietly signing Marquis Daniels to a six year deal at a fairly low cost was a steal.  Thumbs up for the Mavs.  But they still have no defenders, no serious inside presence, and still have the Nelson boys running the team.  Thumbs down for the Mavs.  So it's going to be the same story for the Mavs: they'll put up a lot of points, be very entertaining, win 50 plus games, and lose in the first or second round.  Other than the Heat, I think the Rockets will be the most improved team next year.  This is not Yao's team...this is not TMac's team...now that Francis is gone, Jeff Van Gundy has complete control.  The offense will flow through Yao, TMac will be able to create when necessary, and they have a slew of spot up shooters to complement those two (Howard, Jackson, Piatkowski, Gaines, etc).  I think it will take a year to get the chemistry right...if they click, look out.  They won't be making any serious dips into the FA pool as they need to save some cap room for max extensions to Yao and TMac in the near future.  Under the assumption that they resign Darius Songalia and Anthony Peeler and that CWebb and Bobby Jackson are healthy this year, the Kings should be a better team this year.  Brad Miller's role will be increased, as will Songalia's, as Vlade continues to creep into retirement...if the Kings resign him.  Even though he's 137 years old, Vlade is 7'1', passes better than any other big man in the league, and can knock down the outside jumper consistently.  The Minnesota Timberwolves did the smartest thing by doing virtually nothing besides resigning Troy Hudson.  If they were healthy last year (Hudson, Cassell, Szczerbiak, etc), it's hard to not see them going even further in the playoffs.  The have the balance, size, depth, and shooting to finish in the upper echelon of the Western Conference again next year.  Their relative youth gives them the edge over the Kings.  The San Antonio Spurs are quietly putting the best team together again for 2004.  Take away Derek Fisher's miracle and the Spurs are the NBA champs.  By resigning Ginobili and Bowen and adding one of the top three-point shooters in Brent Barry, they have put all of the best pieces around Tim Duncan for the next several years.  I'm guessing this is about the end of their major FA moves as they'll try to save some funds to offer Tony Parker a contract extension.  At this point they have to be considered the favorites heading into the next season.  Plus they're still well under the cap.           ",male

"             I'm thinking of how wonderful God is. We all know that God loves us and see us as special in His sight, but so few of us really believe it. We question ourselves, we question God, we question everything, even if just inside where no one can hear us. We look at our lives through everyone else's eyes. We view our faults as more important than our successes or good qualities. The thing about God is this: He always sees us for our good, or else His mercy and grace would have failed a long time ago. He sees things in us that we can't understand, conceive of, or even sometimes believe. I absolutely believe that through God we really can do anything. We each have desires living in the depths of our soul that are screaming to be let out, but we're scared and so we just stifle it, as if it's something bad or something wrong. Yet, we still entertain it, because silently we believe in it and hope in it.   God is wanting to do some awesome things in our lives, but we're just all so afraid sometimes. He's screaming for us to let Him, and we're screaming to be let go, yet holding on to the past, holding on to other people's viewpoints and ideas, and holding on to boundaries that others have set for us. It's sad, in reality, to know what we are possible of doing, yet never do.  If we REALLY believed that God wanted to use us, then just imagine what we would do.          ",female

"           I am back..........  Read this carefully. The story given below is quite interesting and  really gives us an insight into DECISION MAKING.   Which one will you choose?   A group of children were playing near two railway tracks, one still in  use while the other disused. Only one child played on the disused track,  the rest on the operational track. The train came, and you were just  beside the track interchange. You could make the train change its course  to the disused track and saved most of the kids.   However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the disused  track would be sacrificed. Or would you rather let the train go its way?

"            urlLink    (USAbasketball.com)&nbsp; urlLink     I personally understand the fears of the players. However, I truly hope no more players drop out of the upcoming Athens games. 5 players were added today. Lebron James, Amare Stoudemire, Shawn Marion, Stephon Marbury, and Richard Jefferson were added to complete the 12 man roster. Here is the  current 12 man roster :   Centers---> Tim Duncan and Jermaine O'neal  Power Forwards--> Amare Stoudemire and Karl Malone  Small Forwards--> Lebron James, Richard Jefferson, and Shawn Marion  Two Guards--> Allen Iverson, and Tracy McGrady  Point Guards--> Jason Kidd, Mike Bibby, and Stephon Marbury  I also read today at ESPN.com that possible replacements are Carmelo Anthony, Ron Artest, Sam Cassell, and Lamar Odom.   First off, I dont think Kidd is going to play. Sam Cassell would be a great substitution. He is a leader and a clutch performer. Ron Artest would also be a great player because he would lead the defense. I am somewhat offended that I haven't heard anything about Ben Wallace. I don't know for sure that he wasn't invited, but he would be perfect for the team.  The team is extremely talented, and even more so athletic. Duncan and O'neal will show us what could have happened if Bird wouldn't have lied to Jermaine in the off-season about Isiah being his coach. If the PHX Suns wouldn't have traded Marbury they would have 25 percent of the Olympic team. I really look forward to destroying the entire World by 50 points per game.          ",male
"             That's right. I've been so busy that I haven't found a free minute or two to post. So much stuff to talk about. I watched virtually all of the Reagan funeral coverage on that Friday. Lots of great stuff. I felt Margaret Thatcher, Bryant Mulrony, and Michael Reagan were particularly eloquent. I was at Support Raising Bootcamp (just outside Philly) on Monday and Tuesday of last week. It was a tiring experience and I cam back beat. Then the very next morning I had a half-day meeting at work and spent the rest of the day flying through all the backed up work from being off for three work days. That night I had small group at Bellefield at got home late and crashed again. Thursday the Financial department went up to Geneva for CCO New Staff Training to meet and present financial info to the new staff. It was a lot of fun to see all the new staff (which now comprises probably at least a quarter of our total staff). That night I went to see  Au Hasard Balthazar  at the Harris. The movie was fantastic (watch for a future MinEx article) but the Harris is really a crappy movie theater. It has one of the worst layouts I've ever seen. Say what you will about R. Sq. and Melwood, but at least you can sit in the middle in those theaters. Got a call from Cooke on Friday night to go out and see  Dodgeball , which was nice since my  Bubba Ho-Tep  party didn't pan out.  Dodgeball  was okay I guess. After seeing something as beautiful as  Balthazar  the day before, it did make me lament the sorry state of mainstream cinema. In a continuation of my 'Evan Does Lots of Stuff by Himself Series' I went and saw  Seven Samurai  at the Oaks on Saturday night at midnight. What an incredible cinematic experience! The movie is about ten times better on the big screen and it was already on my top five movies ever list. Would have been nice to share it with someone, but it their loss, whoever that nameless metaphorical whoever was. Sunday was just crappy. I just spent a lot of time thinking about the cool stuff that I want to do this summer and not a lot of people interested in doing those things. I went to Richard Thompson that night, which was a mistake really. Being in a crowd by myself was lousy and I didn't feel like being there. So before my self-confidence hit a complete low I decided to leave the show early and go home to watch MSTs on the couch. That brings things up to speed I think.  Evil Dead II  is at the Oaks this weekend, no one else is going yet. I was invited to the Dave Matthews concert this weekend, but its way too much money and I've totally just grown out of the music (it feels totally dead and boring to me). Normally I would just say hell with it and go to spend time with friends but I don't think I can afford to go even if I wanted too. In other concert news Modest Mouse will be playing in my hometown on Aug. 10th. It's totally weird, but heck, why look a gift horse in the mouth. MM is growing on me big time. I love their complex and layered sound and the vocals are flippin' amazing. That's all for now. Hopefully updates will be more frequent (not that this one was all that interesting).         ",male

"                   By J.R. Engeriser, Milwaukee Urban Star    Today The New Yorker released information connecting top-level U.S. officials, including Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, to a secret operation that 'encouraged physical coercion and the sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners.'  Known as Copper Green, among other code words, the Special-Access Program allowed for practices far more severe than Geneva Convention provisions, according to statements from intelligence officials in a report by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour M. Hersh.   The Special-Access Program was initiated in 2001 in the early stages of the hunt for al-Qaida in Afghanistan, and expanded by Rumsfeld to the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad last year. National security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, approved the program and President Bush knew of its existence.  The abuses that occurred under this operation received world attention earlier this month when photographs depicting physical and sexual mistreatment were leaked to the public.  According to the report, photographs were taken as part of the operation to scare prisoners into spying on associates for fear that the embarrassing images would be disseminated.   Similar pictures that were obtained by Rumsfeld and Pentagon officials in January via the Armys Criminal Investigations Division went unreviewed because they thought what was in there was permitted under the rules of engagement, an intelligence source said.  Some more severe methods that were not specifically approved were encouraged and uncontrolled. The rules are Grab whom you must. Do what you want.' said the source.  The information comes just six days after an Islamist website posted a video portraying the beheading of American businessman Nicholas Berg in retaliation of the abuses shown in leaked photographs.  Several GIs face prison abuse charges in connection with the scandal, as the Bush administration has maintained that the incidents were the unapproved criminal actions of a handful of individuals.  The Pentagon has strongly denied the allegations released yesterday on the New Yorker website, labeling them 'outlandish, conspiratorial, and filled with error and anonymous conjecture.'  Recent statements from the Red Cross and family members of charged GIs, however, support the implications that sources of abuse practices were further up the chain of command.                ",male

"       About a boy. From my archives. Written in the heat of our post exit interview...   PROS AND CONS    PROS:  *I like the fact that he’s Mexican.  There are good things about Mexican men I like, and there are also things I don’t care for; but it was easy to sieve out things in pieces because they’re so clear cut. I.e.  Good: strong values, strong sense of pledge to family & family values, strong communication skills, strong, strong, strong, masculine, passionate…etc.  *He smelled good all the time even when he thought he smelled dirty, he smelled good to me  *Even when his hair looked a mess, it looked nice to me, like something I wanted to touch  *He was workable (except when afraid of something I didn’t know he was afraid of) - most things he listened to and thought through and came up with alternatives or conclusions, workable solutions…this is rare in men, sadly.  *His eyes were truthful *His smile was connected to his soul. *His loudness was direct and honest *His enthusiasm felt sincere *High energy *Driven *Passionate in every way *Warm *Very affectionate and physical *Very outspoken and for the most part appropriately outgoing *I woke up next to him happy and very comfortable except for one night: *The one night we went to bed tense, when he woke up he put his arms around me and we were fine again, and he admitted that he had uncomfortable sleep ‘cause we argued… I felt the same about my sleep.  *His sense of intuition is very sharp, so it seems *SMART *Wants to learn many things *He felt like me! We were that comfortable.  I couldn’t feel a difference that made me significantly uncomfortable. *AMAZING focus! Like I’ve rarely seen if ever… *Sharp *Chemistry - major thumbs up! Good connection from the start *He worked hard to win me over, not an easy task, even though he didn’t have to… *Friendly even though he’s somewhat a loner *Amazing hand holder, hugger… any touch. *Animalistic …rawr - eats marrow, eats with his hands, looks for the core, the root, driven, digging, tearing, powerful…  *And he cooks too!   CONS   *OOOH suspicions! *WAAY too flirty and aggressive with women to the point of disrespecting everyone, not good ‘cause he ultimately didn’t care about anyone’s feelings if they were hurt or not  *There were times when I suspected that he took this double dealing too far and I tried not to see it that way but it clearly won in the end.  *He wanted me to be part of what he called a “triangle” with 2 other girls that he said were his “best friends” - I don’t believe that structure works at ALL.  In my book the S.O. is #1 and everyone else is a generous #2.  *He betrayed me in the end with one of the “best friends/ex-girlfriends'.  He was physical with her but to what extent I do not know, and I don’t care to know.  So, he lost me.  *EGO - barf! He got a big ego in the end, likely got inflamed due to his discomfort with the quick pace and his inability to adjust/readjust …but that comes with age and experience.            ",female

HEhehehehe  On other subjects, the rain is still here and i love it. Its cooler outside and i love the sound of the rain. Last night was so nice i fell asleep listening to the rain and thunder. The lightning that i was watching drifted away as the eyes closed, and i love to fall asleep like that. I actually had a good time yesterday with Jason, he watched Queer eye for the straight guy. I had fun watching Jason watch the show. I like to spend time with him like that.  Its almost lunch time here so i gotta run!   Back from lunch, oh yummy! Jason and I went to eat at the Macc.

Anyway when you go to the site, there should either be a pop up or you can click on the photo and the comic shows up.

"             The  urlLink Nightjar  is one of Britain’s most intriguing birds. They have an air of exclusivity – you aren’t going to see them unless you go to special sites in peculiar habitats at certain times of year; they aren’t birds you can just bump into.  It was for these reasons that I hadn’t seen one until last year, at the advanced age of 23 – I simply hadn’t been anywhere where there were any. When I was younger, I listened to tape recordings of ‘churring’ and thought what a bizarre, un-bird-like sound it was; they remained one of those mythical birds which were really interesting but that I might never see.  So last year’s experience was pretty amazing. But nobody told me they were going to fly around my head at barely an arm’s distance!  A year on, it was time for a return visit with  urlLink Steve Dudley , former Brecks resident and repository of local knowledge. The Brecks, on the Norfolk/Suffolk border, have some of the country’s largest  urlLink Nightjar  populations in the heathland/open pine forest. On the way, we stopped at  urlLink Cavenham Heath  and saw a family party of  urlLink Wood Larks , a hunting  urlLink Hobby , a pair of  urlLink Little Owls  and a Red Fox trotting around, watched by Rabbits.  Onto the main event. As we walked along the forestry track to the  urlLink Nightjars'  arena, numerous 'roding'  urlLink Woodcock  flew over (click  urlLink here  to hear what that sounds like). At about 21:30, we heard the first  urlLink 'jar  of the evening... a hollow, distant, whirring, rattling, rasping buzz, dipping and rising in pitch every few seconds...   Perhaps I don't have to labour too hard to describe it to you, because you can listen to an  urlLink MP3  here!  Soon, we saw a bird floating against a backdrop of cloudy sky and dark pines... a male, with white wing flashes. Walking further along the track, a young Brown Hare lolloped along towards us next to a timber stack. We heard more churring, saw males flying around and into the forest, before another, much closer bird started up. It's only when you get really close to a  urlLink Nightjar  that you get the full impact of just how... strange the sound is. It doesn't sound like a bird at all, more like something mechanical.  Most of the churrers... churr for a minute or so, then just stop dead. It's when there's a female in the vicinity that things get really exciting. It's all about sex, of course. The churring goes on for a while as normal, before breaking down, coming to a clattering, squawking halt, with exuberant wing-clapping (and probable mating). That's pretty special to hear.   One of the ways to attract a male  urlLink Nightjar's  attention is to mimic his wing-clapping. We tried it, with immediate results... we watched as the male flew towards us, silhouetted against the darkening sky, calling, and flew in a small circle around our heads, having a good look before vanishing back the way he'd come.   The late birder gets the worms, too...     What's in my CD player:  Noyoucmon  -  urlLink Lambchop           ",female
"             Hmmm...  Here it is, around 2pm...and I am waking up. So a few quick comments before my daily defecation and shower:  1) Mikey...Thank you kindly....now I can no longer bitch about not having an iPod mini. Of course, I went ahead and dipped into my savings to go on a $100 shopping spree at the ol' CompUSA apple store. Got an armband, with the SKIN, and the MONSTER cig adapter w/decent FM transmitter for the ol Saturn.  2) I REALLY love driving my sniper van around. This POS is a blast on Saturday night when everyone is drunk. My old two-seater Saturn is lovely, but I get the crap scared out of me when I am rolling through the Drunk-Hour-Traffic from 1:40-2:40 in the mornings Fri and Saturday. I really dig sitting up in the van, so I can see around the Fan corners. Keen!  3) I have met two really DUMB people in the last 3 weeks who operate the check-out stands in stores. Now, I do not have any mean-spiritedness towardspeople of below average intelligence. We aren't playing Jeopardy here, folks. All I ask for is a bit of COMMON sense. Now, if I am being too tough on my expectation of people, please respond to this post. believe me, I will take it all worth a grain of salt, but at least SOMEONE will know that I am/am not a primadonna.   ok...First case: I am helping these fine folks RE-build a closet. No worries. These folks make me constantly laugh at either rediculous BS they have been through at far-off schools, or just at how silly the fact is that all I want to do is eat some fried crap at 12:30 in the morning, but some LOUD-AS-SH!T lady is screaming into my ear singing some nonsense like 'You've got friends in Low places' or some other forgettable tripe...whoops...off-topic here. Ok...so...I was at the Lowes that popped up in the FAN (?!?!), and picked up a piece of Dry-wall. The lady scans it, and it comes into the computer. Now...guess what the lady...who works at LOWES...asks me:  'Um...what is that?' by this point I am a little dumbstruck. I mean...she works at LOWES and doesnt know what drywall is? so I tell her: 'It is a sheet of drywall'. Now the next question is even more classic: 'Right...Right...Um, What do you use it for?'   'Well...most people use Drywall for building....Walls.'  Euthanize me now... please.  ok...Second case: I was at the CompUSA yesterday wasting time and money. I took my dad to see Dodgeball for the ol' fathers day, and it was sold out at the Sh!t pump, so I take him to places _I_ want to go. Lucky him. So he gets to roll down to the Computer store with me. In my constant search for Cellphones, I notice they carry sprint. So...The only person I can find in a red shirt working there is a counter attendant (of which there were about 8 available, and doing nothing). So...I ask her 'I see you have a Sprint banner hanging up, can you show me where the cell-phones are?' - 'No problem, sir....right this way.' Yup....she takes me right over there in a flash....to the CORDLESS WALL-PHONES.  It's a good thing that now, in 2004...people who work at a store with a CELL-PHONE banner outside still have no idea what the contraptions are. If I give you a sledge-hammer, will you please put me out of my misery?  Best,  Brett         ",male

"           Tonight I took my Mom to the movies. First we saw Catwoman. Then we saw The Village. I liked Catwoman, Halle was wonderful in leather. Sharon Stone was cool as well.

The work week is over for me and I am thankful. It has been a long week.  On saturday while having coffee with Wendy at Bad Ass Coffee Shop I looked out the window. As she talked and I listened my mind wandered to what I was doing with my life.  I was watching the cars drive by on 17th Ave. Everyone has a story, a place, someone that misses us when we are gone. Yet as we past on the streets strangers never look our way. Yet we walk with a song in our heart and joy in our step.  I have been thinking about the people that I keep close and the ones that I push away.  I am thankful for the ones that I keep close and that choose to keep me close.  I know that I live in my head and dont say what I should or let everyone know what I am thinking but its a safety messure that has been in place for years.  I think we all carry a burdon and sometimes we find someone to help carry our load and in return we carry some of theirs. Am I wrong? Do we not share the load with the ones that we love? Do we find a small piece of inner peace when we are in love? I guess too many questions and too many answers that dont match... I know that we should be thankful for everyday that we are here and I am but I like others wonder if we are alone here? Or why are not told everything by the government? Why do we have crop cirlces?

"                  Something strange ?  I Peter 4:12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.   In the course of planning and building mission teams, inevitably, there are team members who have to drop.  It usually happens, family plans, jobs, weird circumstances, etc.  To me, it's never been a big deal.  I always make sure the parents are totally comfortable not feeling like they have let someone down, making sure the students feel ok with making a commitment and then having to go back on it.  Life happens.  My trip is not and will not be the end-all/be-all mission trip of eternity.  Even this year, I have had 2 students drop from NYC already.  Both of them had unforseen family circumstances and were totally ready to go, but the trip had to give.  It's ok. But, I just got an email from another student with a totally different perspective.  She felt like a failure because she couldn't make the next meeting and hadn't sent her letters out yet.  The language of the email was doubtful and almost resigned.  I wrote her back to make sure that she knew she was on the team and that the small things of sending support letters and one prep meeting were just that, small.  I believe preparation for mission trips are just as important as the trip itself, but I also know that this student is going to thrive on this trip, it is going to change her worldview and she is going to look at missions so differently.   And the rest of the team, me included, needs her.  And she needs us. Is it no surprise that Satan will attack all of us as we prepare, meet, get to know each other, think about what our summers will hold for us?  Why wouldn't he send elements of doubt and resignation to us to make us believe that we aren't worthy, that we don't have what it takes, that we cannot possibly make a difference....  Whether it's at the beginning of brainstorming and planning summer missions, when I felt like I was most attacked, or today, as a student believes she has let everyone else down, Satan is at the heart of us feeling like something is trying to stop our efforts in bringing the Gospel to the nations.

"         Classical and instrumental music have been my favorite kinds of music ever since I learned to appreciate music other than the songs we learned in class back in Grade School.  Beautiful music always gives me the feeling of euphoria or what most would call “high”.  This is the reason why I usually don’t like other people (especially people who don’t me much) to see me when I “really” listen to music.  I go nuts while listening to MY kind of music.  Good thing most people my age don’t really like the kind of music I love listening to.:)  Music is one of the things that are sure to make me cry.  I used to get teased a lot because of this (well, I still do).  Music makes me want to close my eyes, spread my hands and just be free from everything.  My senses become alive when I hear beautiful music.  When I watch movies,  music is one of the most important things I consider.  Maybe I was a musician in my past life, I don’t know.  All I know is that music resides in my heart and soul.  I cannot live without music.    Last night, I was listening to the  Il Postino  (The Postman) official soundtrack when, as usual, I started to cry.  I was listening to  Pablo Neruda 's love poems being read by famous Hollywood stars.  Poetry is another thing that always makes me cry and is also a very important part of my life (that deserves a whole new blog entry).  After the Neruda poems came the part of instrumental music.  I was trying my best not to cry, but when it came to this part, I just couldn’t stop it anymore.  I cried not only because the music was simply beautiful, but also because I remembered my  Kuya Reynill .  Kuya Reynill was my classmate back in Grade School and High School.  He was really nice, very kind.  He was never the sensitive type.  This was probably why he would always be the butt of class jokes.  No, he didn’t look funny at all.  He was neither clowning around all the time.  He was, in fact, rather serious.  It was just that he had more share of mistakes and, well, embarrassing moments than most of us.  But, not in any time did he ever get affected by this fact.  He would always laugh with us when we laughed at him.  That was how nice he was.  He was a happy person.  I was quite close to him, which is why I was one of the first few to call him “Kuya” (older brother).  He was really like a brother to me.  I loved him dearly (I never knew if he ever knew how much we all loved him).  How could you not love someone who was as kind as to gladly volunteer to get you stuff from far-away stores just because you don’t feel like getting up from your comfortable chair?  How could you not love someone who would always be there to listen to your childish thoughts and foolish ideas?  How could we not love him?  On our third year in High School, Kuya Reynill, knowing how much I loved classical and instrumental music, introduced me to the  Dying Young  original soundtrack.  I remember him telling me how he cried when he listened to that tape.  He even teased me about my crying over beautiful music.  And, so,  I listened to the soundtrack.  As expected, I cried buckets of tears (and I haven’t even seen the movie at that time).  I was just enveloped by the feeling of sadness that the music wanted to create in the listener.  I knew I had to have that tape for my collection.   I told (note that I didn’t ask) Kuya Reynill that I wanted the tape.  He told me it was his cousin’s.  I told him that I wanted it and I didn’t care if it belonged to his cousin or whoever.  He had to beg me to give it back.  I didn’t give it back until he promised to buy me one.  He also said that for him to buy me my own copy of the tape would be really great because I was sure not to ever forget him.  “Every time na marinig mo ‘yun,  maaalala mo ako, ‘di ba ?”  (Every time you hear that piece, you’ll remember me, won’t you?)  I didn’t even appreciate this, I only told him to hurry up and buy me the tape as soon as possible.  He could only say, “ Sige, pagpunta ko ulit sa Iligan, ha ?” (Okay, next time I go to Iligan, alright?)  That made my day.  But, he never fulfilled his promise.  He went to Iligan often, but he would always forget to get me my Dying Young soundtrack.  The days became weeks and months, but the tape never came until I totally forgot about the promise.  I guess he forgot about it as well.  The months became years and before we knew it, we were already graduating from High School.    He went to school in Iligan; I stayed in MSU and never heard much from or about him.  I could count on the fingers of my right hand the number of times I saw him all throughout college.  In no time, I graduated from college.  In the one year that I bummed around, I never saw him at all.  Then, I decided to come to Manila for further studies.  Dying Young and Kuya Reynill became just mere shadows behind larger and fonder memories.  I barely remembered him.    As I sallied through Asian studies and, later, English studies, life became very busy and all about Asian history and culture, Japan and the English language.  High School seemed to have been centuries ago.  The childish fears and ideas had more or less been completely forgotten.  The times I passed and left kept to themselves most memories of the good ol’ days.  It was impossible to remember Kuya Reynill, especially after years of not seeing or hearing from him.  Then, one day, big news of my dear Kuya Reynill came.  It was so unexpected I almost went crazy when I heard it.  It was so unbelievable I wanted to fly back home just to know if it were true.  He was a natural jester, yes, but Kuya Reynill could not have borne to play such a joke- a cruel, cruel joke on me!  I desperately tried to contact everyone I knew to confirm that the news was a just a big joke.  It wasn’t…  Kuya Reynill never got me that soundtrack.  But, he made sure that it would forever remind me of him.  What a great joke he played on me!  He never fulfilled that promise for he had another thing in mind.  I never knew that he wanted that beautiful piece to carry his very memory.  “Every time you hear that piece, you’ll remember me, won’t you?”  I never thought that when he said these words, he was telling me something. I never knew that he would, himself,  be “DYING YOUNG”.    I will be getting a copy of that soundtrack one day.  And, I know that wherever and whenever I listen to it, my Kuya Reynill will be with me.:)            ",female

"           I believe in having principles. As the saying goes, 'One man's meat is another man's poison'. Hence, values of beliefs that one may hold dear may not be so for another person. But principles, I feel, are essential to one's character, demeanour and development. With principles, one is able to choose his path through life without betraying his conscience, without regret nor sorrow. I'm sure that everyone has one principle or another that he follows by. Sometimes, it is tangible what principles one holds by the way he manifests himself to achieve his goals. Besides this, principles are also the basis of our beliefs. Believe it or not, psychologists have made a connection between a person's principle and his religion. How it is so, I will not elaborate, but know that, in earnest, it is true.  Principles...don't leave home without them.         ",male

"       Look at this: http://inspirations.crossdaily.com/shakeitoff/: A farmer owned an old donkey. One day, while leaning in to get a drink, the donkey fell into the farmer's well. The farmer heard the donkey braying loudly and followed the sound to its source -- and found the donkey standing at the bottom of the well.  After carefully assessing the situation, the farmer sympathized with the old donkey, but the well was deep, and there was no way to haul the donkey out of it. The farmer called his neighbors, and asked them to come give him a hand - and to bring dirt and shovels. The neighboring farmers came, with dirt and shovels in their trucks. Neither the donkey nor the well was worth the trouble of saving. The only thing they could think to do was to bury the old donkey in the well and put him out of his misery. It was a shame, but there was nothing else that could be done. As the farmers shoveled dirt into the well, the old donkey was hysterical!  The donkey brayed louder than ever when the dirt hit his back, but the farmers kept shoveling.  Then the farmers noticed what the donkey was doing. Every time a shovel load of dirt landed on the donkey's back, he brayed loudly -- but then he would shake it off and step up!  As the dirt was shoveled down on top of him, the donkey continued.  The farmers and the old donkey got into a rhthym -- the farmers would drop a shovel load of dirt down the well, and the donkey would shake it off and step up. No matter how heavy the dirt, or how distressing the situation seemed, the old donkey fought panic and just kept right on shaking it off and stepping up!  Finally, battered and exhausted, the old donkey stepped triumphantly over the wall of the well! What seemed like it would bury him actually helped him ... all because of the manner in which he handled his adversity. Instead of letting it bury him, the dirt became his road to freedom.  Makes you sick, doesn't it? I first saw this in an E-mail sent to me by an aquaintance. I hate this kind of thing. Life is awful and hard. You really think you can solve all someone's problems by sending them a cheery chain letter? And what was worse was that they had added this:  NOW --------  Enough of that crap . . .  The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock. MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:   When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass, it always comes back to bite you.   It just makes me so mad! The person who wrote tha was trying to appeal to people like me, getting at my cynicism but what they didn't realise was this: Sent into overdrive by the '>Fwd:Fwd: Donkey Story' heading, the cynicism centres of my brain set my face to 'scowl' and the rest of my brain to hate. Therefore, I was still in a state of rage and cynicism when I got to the 'amusing' bit at the end. It may have raised the slightest twitch of the lips in approval otherwise, but as it was, it just sent me further into the hatred of E-Culture. I have some more to say, but this post is pretty long, and I'm afraid my computer will crash, losing it all, so I'll post another. There should be more soon.         ",male

"                 Amazing! I actually skipped a day!! That never happens. Well, yesterday was strange. My neighbor Cliff lost his dog. It's a HUMONGOUS black fluffy Newfoundland, like Beethoven (only solid black), but she's not wearing a collar. If anyone's seen this dog, her name is Ellie, and you should get her and call Animal Care and Control. It's very sad. See, yesterday, Cliff's friend took her to the beach while Cliff was at work and left the garage door open after he dropped Ellie off at home. My dad saw the door open at around 4:00 p, but by then Ellie was gone. So if anyone is in the Glen Park area or anywhere that surrounds it, keep you eyes peeled. She's not that hard to spot. Well, that's all the interesting stuff for now. Yay! It's Friday! Tomorrow I am going to Safari West in Santa Rosa overnight so don't expect anything for the next 2 days.

"              Kitten Update   The kittens flew the coop, so to speak.  They left the porch a few days ago and have been enjoying playing in the yards.  This morning they either followed their momma (Miss Bobbi) into the woods or she took them there. I couldn't find them and called to her, and she and Rascal peeked out and came to me.  Then I saw Stubby climbing a tree.  15 minutes later I looked out and Stubby was climbing a different tree.  He LOVES climbing.   They've been in the woods all day and seem to be having a great time. At first I thought why would they leave the comfort of the deck, where there's food, a soft bed, a litter box and even a toy.  Then I saw them chasing each other through tall thick grass, climbing trees and thought of all the little animals they can chase and realized it is a lot more fun out there.  I'm hoping they'll return to the porch at night at least.  I miss them. :(  They have an appointment to get neutered in a couple of weeks. We may go ahead and take Stubby to the vet this week and get his shots and bring him inside, before he gets all wild on us or gets hurt or someone else snatches him up!         ",female
"             Well, it is still raining here in Rochester.  Strange.  Anyway, I had my interview on Wednesday with the Alumni Association (a.k.a. Office of College Advancement).  It went really well, and they want me to come back to meet the rest of the Reunion staff.  I can't wait!  Could I possibly have a job?  I hope so!  I called my landlord and asked for two extra weeks until I have to tell them if I want the apartment next year.  This will give me time to know if I have a job or not, because I would like the apartment for one more year.  Tonight there is another party at Kevin's apartment, this time it is for Anthony's 'graduation' (or, the end of his two weeks of summer class.  the last party was for his midterms).

"                 I spent some time this afternoon designing a spreadsheet in  Excel    to automatically calculate my grade point average as I rearranged courses and tweaked things to meet all graduation requirements while maxing out my GPA potential. Of course I could do this by hand, but it would take several hours to re-calculate my entire GPA to weigh each different possibility.    The verdict: despite being royaly screwed by my freshman guidance couselor (she forced me to take a non-required unweighted course that I wasn't interested in at all while allowing my competitors to go ahead and take their required courses) I can still come out as first in my class of 450 by   0.00043   of a point. Seriously. I accomplish this by taking my required foreign language classes at the local community college at night for an additional 0.5 weight (not offered at the high school) and then taking on an AP course (for another 1 point weight) in the day schedule slots freed up by this. More work? Yes, but I get to triumph over injustice while setting a new record GPA for my school,  4.602941176 .

VP Singh and Gujral whos political career only allows them to pass comments are also  urlLink against sending the troops to Iraq . And what's the bargain?-   urlLink India could seek berth in G8 for sending troops to Iraq . Ofcourse, the quickgun BJP is taking the mileage out of it by yelling the slogan  urlLink 'Strong India' .

A 19 pages assignment. I was writing while people watched the film in english class. It was a movie named  Hedwig , about a travesty who fled berlin to usa and formed a band, and got his/her songs ripped. The songs were indeed pretty nice(I'm no fan of Rock And Roll so it's a compliment). Did'nt really like the movie, anyway i had that report to write so...   Downloaded a bit of stuff and found  Microsoft Pinball Arcade . As you can see on the picture, it's well rendered and the physics make it play like real tables.

It smells your too firmiliar scent from afar and winds its way towards you without my control. It likes your taste. It's not a taste that it can satiate easily. I wonder where your mind wonders...if it ever goes in search of me. It's only been a week and a half and already revisiting our haunt sends shivers up my spine. It was strange, all the nostalgia that was flung into my face simply by walking through the doors. I'll be going there alone during the year. 'Our trio's down to two' next summer.

"       This book touches a lot of people in ways they wouldnt think possible.I think everybody should read it. It can positively alter the way you think about life. Mitch Albom had always promised to keep in touch with his favorite college professor, Morris Schwartz, after college was over. Of course, he didn't. Some years later, he saw Morrie on TV, where Mitch found out that his favorite teacher had contracted the painful disease ALS. His body, was slowly withering away but not his spirit. Mitch gets in contact with Morrie and they start meeting on Tuesdays to talk about life, death and happiness. Mitch tries to gain Morries insight on numerous scope, not only for himself, but for his entire generation of thirty something. Morrie has a great attitude about life, and also death. He doesn't strive to gain posessions that he doesn't need. Instead, he focuses on people he loves and the relationships he has. Morries goal with Mitch was always to loosen him up, to make him cry before his life was over. He succeeds not only to get Mitch to cry by the end of the book.

"             I took today and tomorrow off work and my intentions were to be very, very productive.  Two of my college friends are coming to visit me from Cleveland this weekend and I am so unprepared!  I moved into my house last fall and have yet to mop the floor.  Now, that might sound gross, but truthfully it does not look too bad!  I live alone and am pretty neat and tidy most of the time.  Well, I used to be at least.  Lately I don't know if it is that I don't care anymore or that I'm just way too tired to do anything but go to work.  Half crazy, half lazy.  There it is again!  I have depression and rheumatoid arthritis and both kind of drain me.  Plus... damn sinus infection or allergies or something is taking hold of my head.  I'm not a hypochondriac, really I'm not.  I'm tired of being tired.  I know to feel energetic, you have to put out some energy.  I need to get off my ass and do some walking.  I know this would be very good for my mood and my joints, yet I don't do it.  A wierd form of self sabotage.  Why?  It's like cleaning my house.  No one is going to know if I do it or not, unless I tell them.  And if I don't care, why bother?  But why don't I care?  I mean, life is pretty good for me right now.  My arms and legs work, I have a job, I just got a new car that I love.  Friday is payday.  I have friends and family.  Sure I'd love to be married and to have no worries, but as humanity goes, I'm living in the lap of luxury and I am grateful.  I try not to get bogged down in any woe is me modes because it's a waste of time and energy and there are so many people worse off that me in the world.  I'm hoping a new 'friend' will send me an email soon... wondering what he is thinking re our relationship.  If he's feeling the friend thing too or is interested in more romantic things.  As for me, I don't feel the sparks.  I like him - he's funny and nice and kind and stable...  but after two dates, a lot of emails and phone calls I just don't get the sparkle in my eye when I think of him.  Do you think that's okay?  I mean I always think I need to feel that within the first few dates or we shouldn't waste each other's time.  Some people think that chemistry can develop over time.  I wonder how much time?    Well, I'm going to play a game of Scrabble.  Maven is set at advanced, which is helping me raise my rating.  I'm not advanced yet, but I'm moving along.  Very exciting, huh?         ",female

I've been working my ass off at the bus company, wondering if this is how I'm meant to waste some of my more formative years.&nbsp; But at the same time I've been spending too much time thinking about other people's jobs.&nbsp; Maybe it's the influence of the work bloggers.&nbsp; I know plenty of people who are just plain unhappy with what they do.&nbsp; They want more, they want want better, they want something else.&nbsp; I want something else too, but it has nothing to do with my job, nothing to do with money or a career.&nbsp; I sometimes think they have a better chance of being rich and famous then I do of getting what I want.  It's almost depressing going through the tri-town area that made up my old high school.&nbsp; I see people five years removed from school still working as cashiers at Foodtown, pumping gas at the Exxon Station, and delivering for the pizza place.&nbsp; All good honest jobs, but these aren't people who should be doing that stuff.&nbsp; There are better things out there than that for them.&nbsp; On the flipside I see people who did their own thing after high school and are now doing ok without having gone to college, it's like they got a four year head start on life and while I'm sure many of them struggled they seem to be doing ok.  This leaves me with some great questions.&nbsp; The foremost being, why did I need to go to college?&nbsp; The answer is simple, I didn't.&nbsp; I would have far more money if I hadn't, might even have some semblance of a life.&nbsp; I highly doubt I would be in the unpleasant state of mind I am in if I hadn't just experienced the five year mindfuck that is Rutgers University.&nbsp; So after a lot of heartache and introspection I can tell you with complete honesty, I did not need to go to college.&nbsp; So the next question is, was it worth it?&nbsp; Was it worth giving up what I did, risking what I did, being in the situation I am in now? The answer is simple, absolutely.  The first year of college was an absolute waste.&nbsp; Not just a waste of school, but a waste of life.&nbsp; I was dead for a year.&nbsp; I couldn't get anything going, I could not be who I was nevermind who I wanted to be.&nbsp; The Darkness had me bad.  The next three years (my first three at Rutgers) consisted of one unbelievably annoying, frustrating year and two years that were fun and interesting (although I can't remember why).&nbsp; But that leaves one year, and for the most part it's the year that you've been with me here for.&nbsp;   Let me tell you about that year in a way I haven't before.&nbsp; Let me tell you something you may not have been able to tell from all of this (  I didn't get to travel the world, didn't get to see amazing things in amazing places.&nbsp; I didn't get to fall in love (nor did I date, or screw, or anything else that people would think love might be).&nbsp; I did learn to love a lot of people, but not in a way they'd like or understand, hell I'm not sure I like it, caring about so many people with so little reason.&nbsp; Makes me sort of vulnerable.&nbsp; Ay, there's the rub.   &nbsp;I changed this year.&nbsp; Not physically, not necessarily in the way I act, or who I am.&nbsp; My expectations changed, what I wanted changed.&nbsp; What I thought of as reality...changed.&nbsp; It's all new to me.  I had fun, I cared about things, I moped and sulked and wallowed and did everything else I usually would...but there was something that made it all different.&nbsp; And for once that something happened to be me.&nbsp; It was because of it, because of them, because of everything...but in the end, it was me.  I could lose that, or not.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Time will tell, we will see.&nbsp; And if you stick around long enough so will you.      ",male

"       hews wanted a poker recap, so here's some recent happenings.  i decided to play some no-limit tournaments to get some no-limit experience.  i'm definitely not as good at it as limit (in which i'm no expert either), but it's a lot of fun.  you get a real surge going all in, which you certainly don't get when you call the big blind in a .5/1.00 hand.  format of the tournament is such: 1)  buy-in for $10 + $1 entry fee. b)  every one gets 800 chips iii)  1st - $50, 2nd - $30, 3rd - $20  as can be seen, 4th is just as good as 10th, which is just as good as a girl in a bug touching contest.  i think i entered about 5 tournaments before finally cashing in the 6th.  i felt like i was improving though, since i gradually moved up from 6th place finishes to 4th.  considering this is my first no-limit experience, i'll take it.  all these tournamenting though has put me down a bit, so now i'm hovering around $95 in my account.  i'm just waiting for hews to sign up for party poker and give me 50 extra bones.  that's tournament money right there.  so with one 3rd place in the bank now, i'm going bak.  all in         ",male

"       Oh goodness....i am so bloody shagged....can't stop yawning.....pretty surprising that i have lasted this long considering i only caught about 3 and a half hours of sleep.  Graduates had planned to hold a mini harmonica training camp on friday, well from what i heard it was just meant for us grads as well, we still suck quite badly at the three slavonic dances thing..so yea, guys decided that we could do with the extra practice, and set the time to meet at five p.m in school.  Being a friday, ah well, had another piano accompaniment class...did aural this time...i sincerly swear that she was trying her darnest not to laugh when i sang all out of tune..oh well.  Rushed down to school...only to find that not a single soul was in sight...found out that those clowns were watching the house of flying daggers at jurong point...crap...wanted to catch that movie too...'Amused' myself by practising those damn violin scales over and over again....exam pieces over and over again till Ls reached yuhua at around uh...5.50? Got himself plugged into CM while i continued yada yada yada.....  When we finally got into the harmonica room at around 8pm? Placed orders for a Mcdonald's delivery...yeap. Then it was practice practice practice till about 11.45pm, then we had to see allan off...and at the same time i agreed to help mdm peng's friend to edit the length of a particular song..well, when you have a friend like Jesper in the School Of Audio Engineering, should be an easy task for him yea?  Nothing really much interesting happened later...had noodles...Ls got everyone amused by yelping in fright at his sleeping position's close proximity to a er well, dead roach corpse. Plugged myself into my discman and into the world of 98.7fm at around 3am as i tried to catch some shuteye....proved to be one helluva choice as i later found out that those clowns i.e yewon and george were causing quite some noise outside the harmonica room at around 4 plus am...disrupting most of the people's sleep..me excluded of course mawhahahahaha.  Heard that they started calling people at about 6 plus am to wake them up for harmonica...goodness, really pitied those victims...jingying, shehui, zu er...just to name a few  victimised people ....all just too some people's boredom...though it DOES sound like fun though...in a twisted way.... *smiles sardonically*   Yeap onto Saturday....shehui seemed ok...heard that she actually wept for Jay Chou when she recieved news that his vocal chords were damaged or something like that...hey girl, its not the end of the world yea? Besides people like jay, there are other people that exist in this world...good example would be adorable little ole moi....LOL ok people i didnt mean to make u guys throw up...just a harmless ego joke...mwahahahaha. Yea well it was just more and more practice...skipped lunch to go do the violin again...uh and then after their lunchbreak it was more practice again until i had to leave for violin class. And OH yes, i SWEAR that Jingning & Co. DELIBERATELY arranged for me to sit next to sylvia...hell, hopefully tongues will stay silent...though its great to be sitting next to yeongsheng again, reminds me of the good old times when we struggled together in first high....ah.... *dabs lightly at eyes *  LOL. Okay i think that the fatigue is making me slightly delirious, and the fact that Ja Rule is rappin away in the background doesnt seem to be helpin in anyway....*yAwn*  Er, so after all that, jesper and allan came over to my house...jesper doing the song editing for me, while allan erm...was just to accompany us and to entertain shehui on msn using a mic...hahaha.  Jesper edited the song very nicely...though gave up while trying to do a second version...and we all just went out to makan at je. Had a crappy plate of hokkien mee, had to order another bowl of noodles, mee pok i think, to appease the very dissatisfied stomach.  So yeap, thats that then....really nothing else to write...woot there we go, done with releasing all my crap..*yAwn* crap i really need to get some shuteye, jesper still wants me to go to his house in the morning...heh we shall see about that....so yea, later people.

She sits there in her skimpy dress, Hair unfurled and in a mess, Only there to impress, With her sexy silhouette.  A youthful boy, of all the guys, Would catch a glimpse of hazel eyes, And suddenly, to no surprise, “Perhaps you'd like a cigarette?”  “If you insist,” a reply would be, “But have a seat here next to me.” An eager face would let her see, His thoughts of her in love.  She'd inch closer, to feel his heat, And slowly make his red heart beat, And there they'd stay, in the lonely street, With voyeur stars above.  She'd bat her eyelashes, and giggle delight, Whisper lovelies in the night, Lightly nibble and gently bite, And promise him her flower.  For thirty minutes, the games they'd play, In that lonesome bus stop sleigh, Until, at last, she'd slowly say, “It's two-fifty for an hour.”          ",male
"        First dream  was to be a taxi driver. No, wait, here me out. It was back in my wee-um days being very impressionable and watching cartoons. It was in fact the increadibly educational show of Muppet Babies that gave me the idea. I had seen in som episode where Kermit the Frog drove a guy to the moon and got a million dollars for it. I was very young and had no concept of distance, money or humor that these shows totally put forth. Trust me, my family- every holiday reminds me of this.    Most memorable  would have to be my most recent dream. What was it? I don't know I can't remember. But no, I do have re-occuring dreams. That would be about tornadoes and snakes. Tornado dreams are never scary they just always have the smae plot line: It's a beautiful and nice day and suddenly I get the urge to look up at the horizon and I see 3-7 tornadoes ominously looming a short distance away all coming towards us. I'm always with a group of people and they just don't see it. They don't realize the danger they're in and so I get everyone to shelter 'just in time' and then after it's done we go out and see the huge amount of damage everywhere. They all say then wow, we had no idea, it's a good thing that you were there to warn us. Then it end. Just like that I'll have it like once every month, every two months, for the last few years.  Also the snake ones, there's a snake and I wake up and I can't move. I'm paralized and tingley with random fright. The thing is, I'm not afriad of snake, I'd be the first one to pick them up and scare my sister/friends with it. I don't get it.     Scary dreams  would be the ones where some one is in trouble or I'm in trouble or there's a 'bad guy' and I'm powerless, he's going to hurt me and I can't scream, I can't hide, I'm just frozen but crying. Just basically the dreams where I can't control them, it gets scary.    Remembering dreams  the only time I don't remember them is if I have to wake up really fast because I'm late for work, need to be somewhere and such. If I have time, and wake up causually (i.e. via not alarm or random cat) I always do remember them. I might write them down if they're noteworth or just weird at the time. I used to totally keep a journal of them, but I have so many of them, and what do you do when you're done? So I threw them all away I had like 12 or so usual notebook size. A good portion of my dreams I don't want to share because I can kinda see my train of thought in the dream and what might have influenced me and it's just not a good idea to make thing public knowledge, or I should say, I've read too much of Freud.   Lucid dreams  all the time, probably a 50/50 mix of my dreams, if I'm getting close to waking up then I can control them, and it's in the few seconds or so when I realize I can control things in my dream and am aware of things is when I wake up. It sometimes feels like I'm looking up into a camera telling myself to wake up, it's all just a dream Anita and stuff like that.   Day dreaming  do I have to be awake for this? If not, I'll at very random times, while driving, while people are giving me instructions for my next project at work, while watching a movie, playing the piano, on occasion having sex, I'll just zone out and still be functioning fine but by looking in my eyes I'm so somewhere else. I've never been in an accident because I've been day dreaming- actually it makes my trip go faster, all of a sudden I'll snap out of it and be like hey I'm approaching my driveway, hey this song is almost done, oh the movie is over. Hrm, maybe I should do a bit less of this day dreaming. Some people take it for absent mindedness- when that's exactly the opposite, I was thinking  so  much I was distracted by what was literally infront of me. Also clearly what ever was infront of me wasn't that interesting or else I wouldn't be day dreaming. I'm not talking about the random productive thinking like making a grocery list, what's on Dave Letterman tonight?, did I remember to water the plants? Daydreaming for me is the stuff where I'm just very much not conscience of the thinking that's occuring.     ",male

I wish he was here with me now... just being with him last night and talking and being close to him was so special to me, I hope he feels the same. I am gonna miss him so much! I wish I could have spent more time with him this summer. Anyways hes all I can think about most of the time. My friend Ashley came over and she got me some gifts, it was realy nice of her, and we got to talk but I was kinda out of it cause I was tierd lol. Oh yeah btw I am rated an 8 on the weird factor of 1-10 acording to Danny haha. Anyways just wanted to drop a line... No one comments on this so people if u wanna leave a message u can click the thingy under this and type me a message I would apprecitate it...       ",female
       Should I be super proud? I just made another insanely stupid blog. That brings my count to about 10 or 13 blogs. O! I just discovered this mmorpg. It looks real interesting and stuff. Why am I not playing it? Cause its not working.    ,female
                 I've been home for two nights because I'm sick and I haven't heard from Jon at all. What is wrong with him? I do not understand at all. I mean does he really not care at all. It is so upsetting to me. I just feel like screaming. I know he has had class but I haven't heard from him at all and it really pisses me off. Almost to the point that I'm not even sure I want to see him tomorrow. He can go have his skanky Niki for all I care. With her he could have had all the sex he wanted and years ago. And he wonders why I think he doesn't care about me. It's totally obvious Jon!!              ,female
"       I am sitting here watching 'Secret Window'. One of the respiratory care people brought it in for me to see. That is probably the biggest saving grace of all this mess is that the people here make me feel as part of their extended family and help as much as they can. They constantly offer to bring me food or movies, always asking if there is anything they can run and get for me. It makes me feel good that at least I am doing something right somewhere.  &nbsp;  Of coarse I rarely take them up on the offers because I don't want to put them out, although I know that it wouldn't be a bother for them at really. The thing that I do take people up on is the movie thing. If people have a DVD that I haven't seen and they offer I always take them up on it because I love watching movies. I will say that there is one disadvantage to this laptop and the smaller screen size. It is harder to watch a movie and do other things on it at the same time. It can be done and I am doing it now but it is cramped. The other thing that I really need to do is to get this thing upgraded to 512MB of RAM. The 256 works well but the graphics subsystem does pull from the main memory of the unit. So right now with 256MB of RAM installed I pull 16MB for the Graphics system and that leaves me with 240MB of RAM available for program use. It is an odd number and some programs that I would love to use have to have at least 256MB. The biggest problem with being short of RAM is that the hard disk spins more and the computer just has to work harder. So 512MB of RAM is in the near future. I also have to save for the Averatec Tablet PC...that looks like it will be a good system. I still have yet to find out the specs for sure on it but for 1300 bucks you cannot go wrong at all. Pretty soon I may be sitting here writing my blog entries and watching a DVD on this machine. If I do get the Tablet PC then I will not upgrade this one...I will instead make sure the Tablet PC is maxed out with RAM as it would be more usefull there.  &nbsp;  Oh so much to see and do...plus I would love to build a new desktop just to build one.  &nbsp;  I would use the majority of the components that I already have like the high end P4 running over 3Ghz, 1024MB DDR500 RAM, 120GB SATA HD, 60GB PATA HD, good video card, DVD Burners (I have two...w00t! but I want to move to a Dual Layer DVD+-R/RW and I can do that for 90 bucks), WiFi 802.11G card. I would roll all those into a newer system maybe based off of the Aria case and a Micro-ATX motherboard. I would love to add a HDTV tuner card from ATi, a much better sound card (perhaps a high end SoundBlaster Audigy2).  &nbsp;  I would love to add 2*74GB Western Digital Raptor 10,000RPM in a RAID0 Array and that would be hella fast, plus the 120GB SATA as a backup drive for videos and music. I do have my eye on a system from Shuttle, it is a new one that has the new P4 packaging, new chipset, and it will accommodate 3HD's, one optical drive, PCI Express graphics and a HDTV card. However that would mean I would have to get the two HD's, new Proc. (at a slower speed than what I have now because to get where I am now in Proc under the new packaging would be expensive, plus I would have to get an ATi X800 video card for the PCIe...that is major moola...that is why I am leaning towards the Aria case, and a Micro-ATX motherboard, and just add bits as I need them. Down the road I could use the case and upgrade to a board with the newer features and such.)  &nbsp;  That is all off in dream land of what I want to do...if I did all that&nbsp;I would love to save and get a big LCD flat panel (like around 30inches HDTV) so I could compute and work on it but it would be good for TV here in the hospital and watching movies...not to mention kick ass gaming. I would love to do all that because once I get through all this shit I could use it in an apartment and have a hell of a setup.  &nbsp;  I have so much I want to do...and I need to get moola to get there. Its just a lot of dreaming right now. However I will get somehow, somehow the Tablet PC...that would just be cool as hell...also Averatec offers a good mainstream PC 15.4 widescreen, P4 3.0Ghz (Hyperthreading enabled), 512MB RAM, 60GB HD, DVD+-R/RW drive, ATi 9600 Mobility 64MB RAM...Basically a good solid portable gaming machine. That one costs about 1300 as well. So if I could I would get two new laptops, the gaming edition and the TabletPC one...if I did that I would ignore altogether the desktop system with maybe a tansplant of cases to something a little more roomy with a better MOBO room for my DVD Burners, lots of HDs...and have it on a network so that I can use it as storage and brawn setup or something...I dunno I am rambling...really really rambling.  &nbsp;  This is a shit post I am sorry. I am bored...so much I want to do but not the energy or seemingly at the moment the mental acuity to do anything...  &nbsp;  BLAH!!!            ",male

"              Kneel before the fitness GODDESS (tm)  And my plans are continuing to come true!  Went biking with Kittens (not Cat...) and her fiance today.  I had to quit after 12 km because my butt was so sore!!  I definitely need a new bike seat.  I used my new bike rack which works spectacularly, plus I can get it on my car and my bike on it all by myself.  Useful for when I want to go to Rocky Point or SFU or something.  Went to karate last night and learned my first kata (series of movements).  It's pretty basic, and I've got the moves memorized, but my stance absolutely sucks.  That's always been my problem with any dance or martial art.  I'm going to be getting a private lesson in a couple weeks, not with Crush-sensei unfortunately.  :)  He apparently is 'very taken' though.  Girlfriends...pfft.  They stand no chance against me.  :D  So, in less than twenty minutes, I'm off for Ultimate practice.  Gragh.  I tired...  But, my room is slowly becoming more clean (330/400 square feet unliveable) and I'm still losing weight (162 this morning)  Happy joy!  Went to Chapters last night just to pick up a text book and wound up getting a text book plus 8 other books.  Whoops.  That happens when I go there.  I got some pretty cool stuff, and it was all on sale.  Anna Karenina, Count of Monte Cristo, The Koran, a book about Druids, mini-solitare card book, 'The Faces of Fantasy' (portraits of fantasy authors VERY cool), a book on herbal teas, and simply so that I could tell people that I own it 'The Encyclopedia of Cheese'.  All this was less than $35.  I love book sales.  :D  Except for the fact that there's no science fiction or cyberpunk stuff in this list, it is me in a nutshell.  The best way to get to know someone is often through the books that they have out.  Me, I'm so muddled that no one could figure me out by this.  :)         ",female

"                 Thank God! The boil alert has been lifted!  In an exercise in overreaction, my home town of Kent has been on a 'boil alert' for the past two days. No contact with 'raw' water--all water for consumption, washing, baths, dishes, laundry, etc... has to be boiled for two minutes before use.  The reason: the city is connecting in a back-up line with a neighboring city and they need to ensure that the water supply remains bacteria free. Of course, these new lines have been sanitized and cleaned thoroughly before use--but there is still a boil alert.  There are a lot of ways this impacts life which are kind of odd: bars and restaurants have been using bottled water and soda, as well as stocking up on ice and using plastic plates and utensils (to avoid dishwashing). The little chaotic touches actually make it a bit fun.  Fun that escapes me, though. I decided it was too much effort and bugged out of town for the weekend. Screw it.               ",male
"       ...but I've been kinda busy.  I'm sure you can understand! Anyhoo, welcome to the second phase of Tales of Sin, where the tales are still dirty and the author is still full of deep, deep rage!   So here's the latest fiasco.  A few weeks ago, this customer's wife called the store and caught The Boyfriend.  Seems she found her husband's stash 0' porn...only it was a stash o' gay porn.  She kept asking questions about her husband's account, but since her name wasn't listed, there was nothing else The Boyfriend could tell her. A few days later, this woman's husband comes into the location where our general manager works, saying that someone had printed up his rental record record for his wife, and that the someone was me!  This obviously pissed off our gm huge, but I didn't do a thing.  No one has ever come in the store asking me to print up a record, and even if they did, I would never do it.  I know better than that.  That's just the kind of thing that would cost me my job. Thankfully I had The Boyfriend on my side, and while staying completely unbiased, he did all he could to assure our gm that I never did a thing, and in fact, the day this customer claimed I printed out this rental record, I wasn't even there! (It's true.  I was actually in Toronto that day!) The customer wouldn't let it go, and kept saying he had the rental history print-up as proof.   He said he would be back in town on Friday, and would be bringing his 'proof' with him.  So for a week, I sat, shitting my pants, scared to death that our gm would believe this customer rather than me and I'd be headed for the cesspool that is the welfare office.  All this time, our gm kept drilling The Boyfriend on what kind of employee I am,  (obviously no one at work knows about us) and as Friday drew closer, the gm seemed to be leaning more towards my side. Friday came, Friday went.  No customer.  No 'proof'.  No shit.  The Boyfriend's theory is that this was a guy who possibly flirted with me once and I shot him down, or he got caught with all his gay shit by the wife, and simply needed someone to blame.  Lucky me.  Doesn't matter now though.  I still have a job, which means you still have something mildly entertaining to read.  Everybody wins!      ",female

"         Ooooooh I like this! Well done to the blogger people who are continually adding more features and making it all lovely for us!       &nbsp;   Once again, sorry for not blogging for a few days! Trying to think what's happened...of course there was Alton Towers...an excellent day as usual. I had soooo much fun. It rained for about 15mins, luckily when we were having lunch, then it was quite sunny...all of the rides were cool. Though I didn't go on Obvlivion this time...once was enough for me (I have the photo to prove I've been on and that's good enough for me!) We went on everything else though, and major fun was had by all.&nbsp; I was soooo knackered on Sunday though, my trapezius muscles and cervical spine were very much damaged ;0) LOL. Seriously though, they were. Also, I screamed so much on the rides (not out of fear, but for fun...you just have to scream on the rides...even on Runaway Mine Train!!) that my voice went all husky and I love that...unfortunately now it is 95% better and only creeks every now and then :( Mmmm to have a sexy husky voice....       &nbsp;   I got the photos for 5 of the rides we went on...they are hilarious. Sorry to H for sharing this, but she looked like she was about to crap herself on Nemises and Spinball Whizzer....OMG on Spinball Whizzer she was shouting 'PLEASE LET THIS BE IT PLEASE LET THAT BE IT!' I couldn't stop laughing (between screams of course)&nbsp; And on Air, she was scared to go on...but it's my fave ride, I love the soariness and how free you feel...in fact it's the only rides I don't hold onto...i love my arms just flying around.&nbsp; And so I told her it's not fast or scarey (because I don't think it it) adn as we were going round she was shouting 'YOU LIIIIEEEEDDDDD!!! Soooo funny!       &nbsp;   Also, I met my sister's new boyf...he seems so nice. Sarah's had shit from men in the past so it's good to see that she's found someone who cares for her so. She's always been drawn towards people who have been such hardwork in the past, something I never could understand, but it seems now she's with someone who she can just be with, and just have fun with. That's a great thing for her and I hope very much that it works out and they're very happy together.        &nbsp;   (I'll post some piccies soon on my website, and for the BBQ...when I get round to it!!)        &nbsp;   Such a cloud has lifted. LOL This morning while I was pouring cereal into my new lilac and pink breakfast bowl and making a cup of tea in my matching cup this morning, I realised that I'm back...long gone are the blues that were making me so insane and I know why, and it's good. Also...note the breakfastness of my morning...I'm sooo responsible. You know I could even feel my metabolism kicking in thsi morning.       &nbsp;   So major problem being I haven't lost any weight for ages and I'm going on holiday in about 6 weeks  (figures correct at time of printing, Karen can take no responsibility for any losses incurred as a result of relying on this information)   So not quite sure what I'm going to do...perhaps my dreams of walking down the street and seeing people look at my gorgeousness should just be forgotten. Because I'm actually ok as I am, I just think that...and I know this sounds big headed...that I'd be quite lovely if I was thinner, rather than being so average as I am now. I guess I just want Paul to have the best maybe.         &nbsp;   Work was excellent today, we had training on a system we use to value PI claims, and I was al brainy and professional.

I love round people, they've got such great personalities ( I wonder if that's been scientifically proven ever)        &nbsp;   Ah well, just a semi quick one from me, I need to go pick up Paul, he's in London this week.

Once, when I ran away from home I slept in my truck in a parking lot. The police ran a scan on my plates. I know this because mimi's dad happen to hear my name on the police scanner. They let me sleep. The night after that, I slept out in this lot in the country on piece of carpet I had in my bed for the drums to sit on.

"       It is way too hot to blog tonight. It must be 105 degrees in my room, making my attempts to sleep futile.   Today I tried to clean my room, but I decided that I probably would be just sitting around on Monday, and I could clean it then.  Went to  King Arthur  tonight with some people. It was okay.  Well, my dad and Missy are going on vacation somewhere this week, and I am going to hang out with my grandma. Which will be pretty awesome, because my grandma is cool. Pretty much everybody that meets her agrees that she is one of the nicest people ever. She is also really accomodating to my late hours and unwillingness to talk to other people while at home. Here, I have three rules. 1) Take out the garbage 2) Eat dinner with family 3) ....I can't remember what three was. (Maybe don't feed Lilly?) At my grandma's house I expect it will descend into complete anarchy. I view parenting as a mutual partnership between equals, and she does also, so it will go pretty smooth. Plus, I am her favorite grandchild.  Today I bought Jack Kerouac's  On the Road , thinking it would give me some good summer inspiration, and an  Onion  compilation. I have upwards of 15 books on my reading pile, but it has been too damn hot out these last few days to get any serious reading done.  In the news today: More Marines dead in Iraq, Edwards fever is dying down, 'W' Ketchup is launched to combat Heinz Ketchup (something clever from the right! whoa!), and Elvis is high on the charts in Britian. A slow news day, which is appropriate because I try to cut down on the news on Sundays.  The heat makes me nostalgic for last summer, where from 11-4:30 all I did was watch Lupin and complain about the heat. In the day, I just go swimming or go for a drive. At night, all I have to do is blog, read, and listen to music, none of which appeal to me right now.  A plus of being a Night Owl is that you get to catch all the great late-night movies. My favorite late-nighters are Bruce Lee movies and the Blues Brothers. The other night I saw Ready to Rumble, and last night I saw Jay and Silent Bob on Comedy Central, if you can believe that. It seems that the movies are either really great, or horrible flops (Ready to Rumble).   Today Chris mooned Hobe no less than  four  times.   As seems to be their habit, Hawkeye and Jeff have went silent. On Tuesday is Hawkeye's driving test, so good luck to him. I doubt he'll need it, as it is really easy. I expected to fail because I only drove for three hours before taking the test, so if you drive even a little before it, chances are you'll pass.  I'm kind of lacking for ideas right now.  30 Reasons Why I Am Great:  30. Usually, when I am waiting for something to happen, I sit around and it randomly happens.  29. When I go to bed at night I honestly feel that I have sabotaged the current social structure, and soon the Revolution will be here and I'll be glad for all the work I did. 28. Unless you are Bruce Campbell, I'm better than you. 27. I haven't yet been entangled in a shallow relationship which would withdraw from my self-esteem bank and ruin my current way of living. 26. I find myself interesting and engaging, which is why I spend so much time alone rather than with other people. 25. I believe that the Truth is out there. 24. I have alienated everyone I have met without coming across as a creepy X-Files fan. 23. I am different from my parents. 22. I am not ignorant. 21. My shoes. 20. I've been shot in the mouth six times, yet I keep rapping. 19. I've been rocking and rolling long enough to do damage to my body, but I don't believe in drugs or alcohol. 18. If I don't know what I am talking about, I keep going anyway, because chances are the other person knows even less than I do. (Hah!) 17. I have a pretty good grasp of concepts and ideas, yet when it comes to individual people I have no idea what I am talking about. 16. I have a T-shirt that says 'Emo Sucks.' 15. On a global level, I care immensely about causes and beliefs. On a social level, I care about change and understanding. On a personal level, I care only about myself. It is good to be a selfish jerk, because if I wasn't I'd probably listen to emo or something. 14. I don't watch late night talk shows. 13. I don't take 'no' for an answer. 12. I am self-serving, yet I don't often cross the line into pretentiousness. 11. Lilly is my dog. 10. I can read really, really fast. 9. My hair is aesthetically pleasing (especially before I got it cut). 8. I make fun of things I don't understand. 7. Bling Bling Bailey, Lord of the Brainerd Underworld, is my sister. 6. I fought the law (and I won) 5. I am an old-school musical purist, not an indie snob but a real elitest asshole, the kind that makes you sick. I am  always  right when it comes to music, and I have trod on the faces of many people who have tried to convince me otherwise. 4. I can play 'Made in NYC' on my guitar,  and  I know all the lyrics. 3. I can say that people are better off for having met me.  2. I am pretty perceptive, by which I mean I read people pretty well. It always feels like an intuitive thing, and I usually know when someone is lying, even if I don't let on at the time. 1. At the end of the day, I'm just doing it for the Cause, to quote Fat Mike. I really have no other reason, no higher purpose, other than to be. So hooray for me, for not reading into things too deeply, having nice hair, and waiting for things to randomly happen.  If you can think of thirty reasons why you are great, I'd like to hear them.         ",male

"                 I tried calling Garth a couple of times earlier this evening, but, everytime I called, I was sent straight to his voicemail. I found this strange, because he usually keeps his cell phone on. After the sixth or seventh time I tried to call him and I kept finding myself reaching his voicemail, I was about to (1) kill the computerized woman responsible for voice mails and/or (2) break into tears.   Now, don't worry, Garth and I have been dating for more than a year and a half, so I wasn't about to cry because I was worried that things weren't going well. Nope, being the secure girlfriend that I am, I didn't worry that he was with someone else, avoiding me, and/or getting ready to break up with me. No, instead, I was the panicky medical student. For some irrational reason, I convinced myself that he had probably gotten into some kind of accident and was in a hospital bed somewhere unable to call me.   Obviously, I had no choice but to work myself into a big frenzy over this. As a result, I found myself completely unable to fall asleep. So, I sat in my bed, stared at the wall, and hugged Schlepp tight. Yes, we were both worried about Garth, so we tried to comfort one another. Finally and, thankfully, my cell phone rang around midnight. It was Garth! Something urgent had happened at work that he needed to take care of, which was why he was unable to answer his phone and/or call. Apparently, a fight broke out (a bench clearing brawl, mind you) during this softball game that his work was holding. It sounded pretty bad. But, thankfully, no one was hurt. So I'm very relieved.   Unfortunately, I am still unable to fall asleep. Though, the last two yawns I just experienced might be evidence to the contrary. So, perhaps, I should crawl under the covers and try to hit the sack. I bid my readers adieu (a multitude, I know) for now.&nbsp;  Also, of note, I feel like a complete idiot for overreacting. Girls. They're crazy.&nbsp;                 ",female
"              I was in the mood to annoy people.  Haven't gotten any sleep when he texted and asked if I could meet him outside, drizzling and cold, so that he could have someone by his side to share his loneliness. True to the fact that I'm more than a good friend, I readily agreed to his proposal.  He thinks that his girl is having an affair. Since I was in the mood to bitch, I told him that I saw her in the mall, with this guy and they were holding hands and sharing a good laugh. He asked when was this.  About three weeks ago . He was surprised. And angry. Guess to whom?  Yours fucking truly.   Better try me in a good mood. Better yet, ask me something like if there is no available water around you and all you got is a surrounding of oil spills, will you drink from it?    SAGOT!     Will you ever learn?   *****  It was karma. I was annoying all living creatures that came across my senses last night, even with this friend who is a Joross lookalike. Nothing beats a good laugh when you're really tired and you wanna sleep but your eyes and spirit seemed not to cooperate. Aside from the bitchy remarks I laid on everyone during the AA meeting, Joross lookalike I bet is thinking if he should have had me deposited in Mental last night.  Too mental.   So when I received the text of Mike that I was in the headline of tabloid today, I couldn't help but think that this is just a pseudo-but-not-nearly a backfire.   'Boobsie, headline ka talaga!

"        This post actually refers to Saturday's run but I started blogging it and didn't have time to finish yesterday.     Hey, this is fun...        Ok, another good run for me today!  First of all - I wish it could be spring forever because the low 50's, breezy, overcast with intermittent sun is my most favorite favorite weather for running!  And that's how it was today.         I mentioned last time that I started out with a 5 minute run rather than a 5 minute brisk walk before stretching because I didn't think I was getting warmed up enough.  See, in my usual 'finding my way as I go' routine, I thought that I should absolutely not run a single step until I had stretched, but I knew I shouldn't stretch cold.  Well let me tell ya, this 5 minutes of running right off the bat feels like it's made all the difference in the world.  I just feel stronger when I start off on my actual run/walk reps and my endurance has been greater!  Now it's only been twice that I've done this but my response was immediate.  The other thing - and this is one of the silly mind games that I play with myself but that seems to be effective - is that I take longer with my stretches after that initial 5 minute run - which I expect can only be good.  Prior, I rabbit-ed through my stretching because I was so eager to  get running  , but now I'm more willing to take the time and prolong my stretches and stretching repetitions.   It's not the first time I've been called 'loose'...        It's not that I'm not putting effort into my running, but it's taking a little less effort.  Here's the thing - I went to the Black Belt graduation demonstration last night at my (former) martial arts school.  I was watching the sparring and, not for the first time, noticing that the best fighters were the ones who were relaxed, free, almost casual in appearance - but then they'd throw a punch, or kick, or block and they were fast and fluid.  My downfall in sparring was that I was always wound up in a tight little ball and it took too much time and effort to get out of it to be effective.  So I made a conscious effort to loosen up today while running - unclenched my fists, let my neck relax a little so my chin wasn't sticking out ahead of me, and let my shoulders swing a little more.  I had no idea how letting my shoulders go would increase my momentum and rhythm!  I'm trying to make sure I don't end up sashaying down the trail with shoulders and hips flopping side to side but I sure do feel a little freer!   Freud would have a field day...         One of my goals for running right now does not have only to do with fitness or endurance but with psychological growth - that being the curse of perfectionism.  The reality of  my  perfectionism is not that I work myself into the ground to attain unrealistic self-expectations, but that I quit most endeavors well prior to completion because my expectations are not only unrealistic but that I constantly compare myself to others, and when I fall short I crap out because it's way safer than my constant perception of failure.         This is probably why I like to run alone and why I am wildly self-conscious when I meet other runners along the trail.  Today, the running super-couple passed me (twice): he with large, hard grapefruits where his calf muscles should have been and she with a beautiful, smooth stride and chit-chatting all along the way, seemingly with no effort at all.  I have to – and have been – reminding myself that they may have been like me sometime in the past, and I may be like them someday in the future.  I’m not going to run a marathon tomorrow but that doesn’t mean that I can’t be, or in fact am not at this moment, a runner.     Better – Faster – Stronger…        On Thursday’s run (which was my first run that felt awesome to me) I went 2.62 miles in 42 minutes.  That being in 5 minute:1 minute running/walking intervals.       Today I went 2.79 miles in 42 minutes  - same intervals.  I picked up the pace a very little but felt even stronger during it!  I know for most people this sounds incredibly slow but this week has felt great to me  - I am definitely encouraged.  Next week I plan to increase to 7:1 intervals.  At the end of June there is 5 mile fun run that suddenly is looking like it might be do-able!!         ",female

"            YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY I'VE GOT PORK IN MY TUMMY   Last night we went to dinner with Bart & Tim at the Heaping Bowl in East Atlanta.  I have further explored my fascination with chicken salad.  Prior to dinner, we took a 'sticky b' through Traders and I enjoyed one of my favorite retail past times... smelling handmade soaps.  How do you make a soap smell like sex?  I didn't chance it.  I skipped it and went on to pink lemonade.  I enjoyed the 'Joy' candle as well.  I never knew what joy smelled like.  Unfortunately, they were out of the 'Teen Spirit' candle.  I would have liked to have smelled that one.  Today I woke up early.  I did things around the house.  I had lunch with David.  I went to CompUSA to return the fire wire card that I did not actually need.  I came home and cleaned the bathrooms, vacuumed, swept, did laundry, etc.  I sat down to read on the couch with my favorite pillow, and old comforter and Buddy, the wonder cat.  It was nice.  I had candles lit and one of the many Buddha Bar CD's on.  Jeff went antiquing today and met Jay Baker, Jim & Tammy's son.  He has body piercings and tatoos and has a ministry in Little Five Points.  Jeff has always been very interested in him and I bought him Jay's book to take on his missionary trip to Honduras.  Jeff may go check out his ministry.  We went and had barbecue near the airport.  It was very tasty.  Jeff's best friend, also Jeff,  is in London, Ontario with his dad.  Mr. H is in the hospital trying to gain his strength back to renew chemotherapy.   Keep him in your prayers.   I had a dream once where an angel came to me and said that worry was like growing thick vines and weeds around us and prevents God's angels bringing our good to us.  He said that faith affirmation clear the way to God's light.  I hope that's true.  I remember that every time I start to worry.         ",male
"                 So I am eating a Rice Krispies Treat.  It's quite yummy but also very bad for me and I should stop eating it.  But it is about the only festivity in this otherwise such boring day.  I just finished my first essay for history and it is dumb but I used a lot of big words (for me) and so that is lovely.  Now, I must read the 60 or so pages that I still need to read from my book for my history term project.  And after that I need to write a whole other essay, again for history.  Then I shall need to read about 60 or so pages for English too (whish I must admit is more enjoyable but still something I'm forced to do).  This is going to be a long day.    So, also, yesterday my mother and I went to Wrentham after the BC vs. UCONN basketball game, which was super cool and I saw Miss Sarah there so that was also cool.  So at Wrenthem, my mother needed to find a new suit at the Kasper store because she has a lot of meetings in Boston this week.  So, actually the one she chose was quite nice, but it is amazing how long people can spend in a suit store.  We were in there for over an hour, definitely.  It's really weird because one of the ladies who works there, whom I now know is named Allison, I definitely remember from the last time I was there and it was just weird.  Even weirder was that I remembered that she has a son named Tristan, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how I knew that, so that was weird.  So after that long long long-ness in the suit store, we went to a Puma store, but it was not cool at all like our wicked super cool Puma outlet.  Then we went to the Gap outlet and I got a really pretty black short sleeve shirt that is really hard to describe, but yesterday was the day that we first started shopping for my birthday, which was uber cool, but that means that I don;t get to have my lovely shirt or the cool denim capris that I got at Old Navy until my birthday.  I found the coolest olive green capris that I loved, but they only had one pair an d it was a size too small so I definitely wasn't super psyched about that one.  Then we ate at Chili's again and came home and I can't remember what else I did after that.  Oh yeah, I think I just read my magazine that I got yesterday.  It had a really sad story about this school that has had so many deaths in just a few months.  It was so sad.  Then I went to bed.  Lovely.             ",female

"       Metroid Prime is an awesome game, but i think i'd like it even more if it didn't involve so much backtracking.  it doesn't have levels, as it were, but a giant world map where as you gain new abilities you can access new areas on the map.  however, it's not a linear progression, which - though it may be more realistic - becomes frustrating when you start wondering 'is this the seven-hundred-fifty- first  time i've been through this room or the seven-hundred-fifty- second ?'  i think importing the warp feature from the zelda games would have provided a significant improvement.  in zelda, you have the same kind of expansive world map, but once the area you can access reaches a certain critical size, you start discovering warp zones placed at key locations.  now, they aren't exactly sprinkled about liberally (Ocarina of Time only had 4, to my recollection), but there are enough to cut down on the dead-time.  of course, i'm sure that purists would decry this addition to the Metroid Series, so it's never gonna happen...  ah well.

And yes, for my first time doing things for him, i did Sushi for him. He wore a blue sleeveless t-shirt and jeans. HE wore his spectacles. He looked like a decent chap, lolz. He looked nice. Muack~* He comments that the Sushi is nice. Glad to hear that. :)   The bbq was alright, more than enough food to go around. We had 2 guest of honor. lolz. Not that bored with them around.

"       School was canceled yesterday so we could attend the Evangelism Conference (yeah we Baptist are so creative with our names). Henry Blackaby was the Key note speaker along with John Franklin (a guy from Life way who did an excellent job as well). Blackaby spoke on 1 John 1:1-4   That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched--this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to make our joy complete.  1 John 1:1-4 (NIV)  He made a statement that resonated with the core of what I believe. “Eternal life has come to mean getting to go to Heaven when you die; but the Bible says that’s not Eternal life.” Eternal Life according to verse 2 is a relationship! So you and I can have eternal life today!   He went on to explain the reason so many of us don’t witness. Again, his message was  life a tuning fork in my ears, only it started to get painful. We can not bear witness to that which we have not, or in some cases are not, experiencing. In other words if we are experiencing a close intimate relationship your just going to tell others about it. If your not then your going to have to force yourself, or simply remain silent. Ouch!! That’s hard for me to hear, but it’s absolutely true. Which means I need to do some re-evaluating            ",male

GESTALT Theory.... this guy Fritz Perls and others developed this psychotherapeutic approach in the 1940’s... using this holistic approach...  'Perls’ basic premise was that life happens in the present – not in the past or the future – and that when we are dwelling on the past or fantasizing about the future we are not living fully. Through living in the present we are able to take responsibility for our responses and actions. To be fully present in the here and now offers us more excitement, energy, and courage to live life directly.'  urlLink http://www.gestalt.on.ca/new_page_one.html   Hell if I knew where this thread of knowing went.... so this is just something to chew on...

I hate the corner flower bed, because it's not even a flower bed it's a lavender bed!! My mum is obsessed with lavender so she decided to plant like 4 different kinds in one flower bed. So we just started cutting away!!! Haha, it was soo entertaining! I gave up part way through because I sort of became useless, and I went inside to take a shower. This is just sad I had pieces of lavender in my hair!!!! Maybe I'll be able to plant nice flowers when we're done with this!!!

"                  Lesson 14: Mox without Sox   Teenagers like dressing well. They have a lot of fun with clothes (actually, teenagers also have a lot of fun without clothes… see this book’s chapter on sex).  Basically, there are three sorts of dressing: informal dressing, dressing for dates, and thousand island dressing.  Informal garments (i.e. what you wear to movies, pop concerts, the beach etc), are the Number One most important clothes you should have in your wardrobe. This is because  you are most often seen in them.  Your jeans must be your most important piece of informal wear. Good jeans follow the three T’s principle, namely:   Tight  – Only children and middle-aged dirty old men wear loose-fitting jeans. The true teenager wears jeans which sharply reveal the hips, thighs, bottom etc. Remember: if it ain’t tight, it ain’t right.   Tough  – Tough jeans are good jeans. This is highly sensible because of the highly energetic life teenagers lead (including rough activities like watching movies, lounging at fast-food restaurants and catching the number 7 bus at Orchard Road).   Tapered  – Finally, jeans must be tapered, or a least straight. Nobody except Lucky Plaza salesmen and Australian tourists wear bell-bottoms.  The perfect top to complement jeans are T-shirts. Generally, your T-shirt can come in any colour, as long as it’s white. Sleeves should be about an inch (okay, 3.1 cm) above the elbow and collars should be round and covering the collar-bone.  Finally, footwear. For guys, leather tennis shoes are suitable for anything except playing tennis. Boating shoes (e.g. Topsiders) are also acceptable – unless you decide to go boating, in which case you should wear tennis shoes.  Girls may wear flat-soled leather shoes (no high-heels, on informal occasions, please), or moccasins. Of course, the rule to follow is “Mox without Sox”, i.e. wear moccasins without socks.  Good clothing for parties include the…                ",male
"       ' Life would be much simpler if there were not so many rules. I imagine I have broken every rule of English grammar several thousand times and being at heart a purist, I should be desolated if I was aware of it, but as I do not know a single one of these rules, I am saved much mental anguish. '    ' When I first started in to write, I was sort of ashamed of it as an occupation for a big, strong, healthy man, so I kept it a secret. No one helped me. No one knew what I was doing -- not even my closest friends. Now I've come to the conclusion that writing is a 'pretty nice' way to make a living. '   ' There is a vast difference between seeing life and living life. I believe I have done the latter. In fact I don't think I could have written much if I hadn't. (ERB had served in the US Cavalry in Arizona, been a gold miner in Oregon, a policeman in Salt Lake City, a cowboy in Idaho...) [But]...It is necessary for nearly all of us to acquire part of our 'experience' second hand. Yet this should never be permitted to overshadow the greater art of imagination. '   ' Get the habit of work and quit being an 'inspirational' author -- which is merely another name for a loafer. Don't wait for ideas to come. Go after them. Don't write every now and then. Write every day, if only for a little while. Be a worker, not a poseur. The only real 'literary people' are those who work at it. Those who make good are the ones who keep so busy that they have no time to show off. '   ' (Tarzan) was just a character that happened to catch the public's fancy; interest in him grew until it astonished me. As a boy I love the story of Romulus and Remus, who founded Rome, and I love, too, the boy Mowgli in Kipling's 'Jungle Books.' I suppose Tarzan was the result of those early loves. Perhaps the fact that I lived in Chicago and yet hated cities and crowds of people made me sense, my escape from unpleasant reality. Perhaps that is the reason for his success with modern readers. Maybe he takes them, too, away from humdrum reality. Mrs. Burroughs calls me a low-brow. I guess I am, but then so are the most of us, aren't we? Perhaps that is another reason why Tarzan appeals to the mass of people rather than to a select few. '   ' I find that a considerable part of my work in writing fiction has nothing whatsoever to do with fiction. It is based upon the belief that highly imaginative fiction, such as I write, demands the retention of a youthful and elastic mind, to achieve which one of my principal aims in life is to keep my body physically fit and my mind responsive to a diversity of simple stimuli. '   ' If you've written a good story, don't lose faith in it if it does not sell -- but first be positive that it really is a good story.... Even now, I often have a difficult time finding publishers for my latest books. I get lots of rejections. '   ' For me, temperance is essential to good work. Simple amusements are the most desirable, and so far I have successfully avoided the acquisition of any sort of a hobby. My own observation leads me to believe that a single hobby is too narrowing an influence for a fiction writer and I should rather suggest the greater value of an interest in many things. I find that it is better to have a little knowledge of many things than an expert knowledge of one... '   ' If you write one story, it may be bad; if you write a hundred, you have the odds in your favor. Play the long shots. It's better, of course, to write one good script than a hundred poor ones, but usually you must write a hundred poor ones before you can do one good one. '        ",male

Well, before you judge you must understand I can't live without the font Minstral AV. It's one of my few human weaknesses I'm allowed. It's not something I’m proud of. At first I was just using it casually, maybe with a few friends, or when I was feeling down, needed to make something look semi-handwritten, but obviously typed. I was stupid to start. I didn't even find my fix of Minstral AV, I had to bum some off an anonymous friend, we will call her C. Prophet, no that's to obvious, we will call her Curbside P. Well, I guess I shouldn't say friend, a real friend wouldn't have given it to me...  Anywhoo, I'm now in a loosing war against Pop-Ups. A war many have fought, few have won.

It is because you are here, and I can wrap my arms around you, smell your hair, smooch your face and everything is just fine.  I think parenthood is God's gift.   It humbles you.   It helps you return a little bit to the simplicity of life, watching cartoons, running aimlessly through a park chasing birds, learning to draw elephants..

"       Hello again all.  Well...there's no one online at the moment...the usuals that I can't exert any social talents on, the robots, the people that I'm just not going to give an SN to right now because I don't want to face up to what they have to say at the moment. So I thought I would just come in and make me a nice little BLog right quick.  So lately I've been playing the role of psychologist, and I must say...it's really weird. I don't know where it comes from but it does, like a little river it flows right out until it's coming like a torrent. The silence thereafter is one of bliss...it's the satisfaction that I got to the core of some long hidden or ne'er disclosed truth.  There was a few days after it first happened when I had to come to grips with myself after feeling that 'unnamed feeling' for the first time, and being able to deal with the fact that I just knew these things, and that I didn't have to know where they were coming from. It was hell, it was feeling hopelessness for just a few hours. And then something clicked when I was talking to Rosie one day, and that little lightbulb just clicked on, and suddenly it doesn't feel that bad anymore, it doesn't seem like I'm entirely helpless, and that I may not be god of the universe, but if I can put a bright spot in someone's day once, that spot can grow and multiply. It's like planting a tree in an empty field.  In other news....I GOT ONE OF MY MICS THE OTHER DAY! w00t! So I have the guitar mic with which I recorded  Master of Puppets ...at least, some of it. DEAR LORD. It sounds so much better than plugging straight in with the POD like I have been doing, not so low end and muddy. So now...have to record all the demos AGAIN. But it's ok because I've grown to love recording. And this time we've been offered some help with the process which would be very nice...Abby already knows how to work the damn thing and that's awesome. So maybe she'll do it and then I'll cry because the recordings will sound even BETTER! Because I won't have to reach for the buttons and cause excess noise when I don't want to. Allz I have to do is twist, plug, and play. JOY! Of course, that is assuming Abby even reads this...I wonder.  Rosie thinks I look....'cute'.....with my little streaked blonde hair bit after getting some sun. Um, well, if she says so. Personally it just makes me look...gay. It's my duty to the world to keep up my facade of darkness and melancholy, and that blondeness just puts a few key dents in the gloomy shell. But I want to get a bit of a tan too so as to not look...so pasty? Sunless tan, here we come.   People are odd.   Well some people, at least. We all get divided into our own categories.

"       Dream: I walk into a club that looks not entirely unlike the Tractor, early, for an X show. John Doe is working the door.  I ask him how're things, and he decides he remembers me from the last solo show, so he ushers me in as if we're old pals. His hair looks more like Billy Zoom's, though it's John Doe color, albeit with a good deal of grey in the mix.

"             Free Floating thoughts.......  Why does it seem I don't hear from anybody anymore? Where has everybody gone? Granted they are no longer single like me, involved in relationships or married and busy raising children. But are they that busy that can't call or stop by at all? I know I'm the one with more time..... But that doesn't solve my feelings. What transgressed?  How can I make things better? What has transgressed?

You can always talk to your friends, your true friends, even how unintereted they are they will always give yous ome helpful advice.

"       Are people who ask, 'Don't you get bored?' lacking in imagination? I always wonder. Why would they think I might get bored being alone all day if not because they get bored with nothing but their own imaginations as entertainment?  No, I don't get bored. I could entertain myself for an eternity, I think. I enjoy my own thoughts. There's a statement for you: I enjoy my own thoughts. I like the way my imagination works. I get a kick out of reading books that provoke flights of imagination. I love reading a book that has so many interesting ideas in it that I have to stop reading every few minutes just so I can gaze off into space for a while thinking about what I've read and how it fits in with other things I know. I like making the connections that flower into brand new ideas, brand new ways of understanding. Thinking give me tremendous pleasure.  There are more extroverted people in the world than introverted people. Or--maybe it just seems that way. The extroverted people are the ones you see. All the introverts are home reading. I think it's the extroverts who ask that question: 'Don't you get bored?'  I never wanted a career, you know. I only worked at whatever jobs I've had for the past 30 years because I had to in order to get the money I needed to do the things I really wanted to do. What I really wanted to do was read books, cook delicious exotic food, listen to music, play on the computer, work in the garden, think about things... With most of the jobs I've had, I was being paid to think about whatever it was my employer wanted me to be thinking about. You work at an insurance company, they expect you to be thinking about insurance while you're there. It's only fair. One of the best jobs I've ever had--in some ways--was when I worked as a hotel maid cleaning toilets, vacuuming floors, and making beds. I could think about whatever I wanted when I was doing that job. I'm telling you the truth: I did some of my best thinking while cleaning hotel rooms! Unfortunately, the pay sucked so I couldn't afford to do any of the other things I really like to do.  The truth is, there's no paying job on earth that would allow me to do the things I really want to do. My interests are simply too broad to be pigeon-holed in a career of any sort. As an old friend of mine once said: Specialization is for insects. What's a Renaissance Woman to do? I really just need a wealthy patron, I guess. And, I guess, I more or less found him.  Now I have the time and--thanks to my spouse's income--the money to finally do what I really want to do. I read. I garden and cook. I play flute and oboe. I mess around with the computer. And I do all the cleaning, cooking, and chores associated with running a household. Since I'm not bringing any cash into the relationship, it seems only fair. Besides, I don't really mind it. I like it when things are orderly. I keep pretty busy. I bake bread. I listen to music and sing along. I think things through.  No, actually, I don't get bored at all.    ",female

"       A Quickie on Global Opinion  Before I get to watch the New Look Red Sox for the first time since saturday's trade, I wanted to post quickly on something Mike brought up in the comments section after my post on  urlLink  Lost in Translation /theDNC/basic Democratic Party policy .  As a rebuke of my position that the Dem position that we should be more like Europe is completely crap, Mike brings up opinion polls around that currently show most people elsewhere in the world have unfavorable opinions of President Bush and the U.S. He then concludes 'We no longer have the luxury of being governed by the school of isolationism.'  Firstly, I don't think Mike is really referring to the school of isolationism. In IR, that school argues that the United States policy should be derived from a principle of 'mind your own business.' It's philosophical underpining is drawn from George Washington's farewell address that advised the US from becoming involved in the entangling politics and alliances of Europe. Applied today this would mean not becoming involved in anything abroad that doesn't directly affect us at home. The US would withdraw from NATO (with no USSR, it has lost its raison d'etre), withdraw from our mutual defense pacts with Japan/Taiwan/SouthKorea, etc etc. In the context of the challenge of global terrorism, this strikes me as insane BUT there are those out there, serious academics and polititians, that feel this is what we should do, and generally they're in the Libertarian camp. They argue that if we didn't have so many troops in the middle east or support Israel, Radical Muslims wouldn't hate us--and having close to no troops committed abroad would save boatloads of money that we could spend on education and healthcare.  Of course, I think Mike mispoke, I think he's referring to Unilateralism, which is what our European critics abroad and the Democratic critics of the Bush Administration at home have been accusing us of since we decided to go to war with Iraq without the formal approval of the UN. Unilateralism as it's latin roots clearly implies means the U.S. does what is in our best interest often without consulting or co-operating with other nation states; we go it alone if we want to/have to. Unilateralism lately falls under the banner of the School of Primacy. Primacy is the foreign policy framework where the US does everything it can to maintain it's position as the global system leader--biggest economy, military, most influence in NGO's.  Citing global popular opinion, I believe Mike and certainly Europeans and the rest of the planet want us to follow the tenents of  Multilateralism . This would mean that we wouldn't have gone to war with Iraq because the UN didn't give us approval and several countries out there wouldn't join GW's 'Coalition of the Willing.'  Multilateralism sounds peachy, it really does. A bunch of countries get together to do something they all agree is the right thing to do and will benefit everyone. Unfortunately, the current global system doesn't relate well and global popular opinion forgets this. First, the collected nations of this planet do not share the risks of international terrorism equally. It's pretty obvious that the US and Israel face the brunt of the hate of Radical Islamists. Second, the costs of stopping the terrorist threat cannot be shared equally. Put simply, the US spends the most absolute money on defense of any country on earth and it  outspends the next 10 countries on the list combined . So, as much as everyone here in the US would want other countries to supply more troops and supplies to our effort in Iraq, other countries just don't have it in the cupboard. The last obstacle to true multilateralism is that global concensus is almost impossible to reach. Terrorism isn't the easy call of Nazi Germany where it was relatively clear that Hitler was not going to stop until he took over the world. The US and Western Europe just don't have the same interests when it comes to terrorism.  Defending the United States and being it's President is not a global popularity contest and it shouldn't be. The President, regardless of who he is, is responsible and accountable only to American voters. And this is the disjuncture of the Democratic Party. They argue that having Europe on board would make the war against terror easier, but the bottomline is that most of them don't have significant resources to offer to the cause. Ultimately, I don't want a popular President or government, I want an effective one.  If you're questioning President Bush's effectiveness, please consult Mr. Kadafi.          ",male

"       I have started a new research project where we look at how the current cholesterol regulation guidelines are being implemented in primary care facilities. It sounds very interesting, n'est-ce pas? Since high cholesterol is an indicator of potential cardiac disease, this is important. You can go to  urlLink  Heartage.com  to enter in risk factors and find out how high your risk is of having a heart attack in 10 years. I am happy to say that even with my high cholesterol and all, my heart is a young 23.   In addition to this high cholesterol, people on both sides of my family have had heart problems in the past. However, I don't feel that I'm going to die of a heart attack. No, that's not the way my life will be ended. Cardiac problems are the least of my worries. What will do me in will be liver failure.  Maybe my next research project should be to figure out one's liver age. Because mine, definitely, is at least twice my real age. Poor liver. At least it can regenerate itself, as long as one doesn't abuse it too much. However, nothing in moderation, not for me!

"              'A Long December'   It's hard to believe that it's already December.  Finals are in about a week and a half.  Granted, I don't have finals (I have a 20 page paper to turn in, but that's due the week before, so that doesn't really count).  But it's almost finals week.  It's almost the end of the semester already.  Eesh.  It never ceases to amaze me how time seems to move faster now than it did when I was younger.  As a small child, minutes seemed to drag by for an eternity.  Hours were like the migration of glaciers.  An ice age could come and go during a full day.  The weekend always seemed eons away, unreachable except by someone with Methusalah-like age who managed to survive the hundreds of years each weekday seemed to last.  Granted, the weekends still went by like the blink of the proverbial eye, even as a child, but that's relativity for you.  Now, of course, there never seem to be enough hours in the day.  Maybe it's because I'm trying to cram more into each day, whereas when I was a child, there weren't that many demands on my time--school, homework (when I bothered with it), play, eat, sleep.  That was about it, right?  And there's so much more to life now, which is good, of course.  But sometimes I miss those halcyon days of youth.  Sometimes I miss the fact that a year felt like a year.  Now, it feels like no time at all.  I mean, I shouldn't be about to finish my third semester here at OU.  Hell, as far as my internal body clock is concerned, I really should still be at Ozarks.  Which just goes to show, I guess, that my biological clock needs to be wound.  I guess time only seems to move faster.  I've never read anything that says time really does go faster as you get older.  That'd be kind of weird.  Your grandparents aging faster than you do, so that they have two birthdays for each one of yours or something.  But I guess it makes sense that time feels like it's moving quicker as I get older.  I mean, each year is a smaller and smaller chunk of my total life.  When you're ten, a year is a big chunk of your total time on the planet.  Now, it's not even half as big a piece.  Soon, a year will just be a drop in the bucket.  Which means my life will be going 'plunk' very gently.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, 'Meaning of Loneliness'         ",male

"                 Yesterday, I paid 30 bucks so my kids could sit on a giant bunny's lap and I got the pictures to prove it.  It's like seasonal insanity.  Some holiday hits and I completely lose all grips on reality.  In reality, a teenage girl puts on a big fuzzy yellow bunny costume and lets my children sit on her lap whilst her girlfriend snaps crappy pictures with her digital camera and then prints them out on less than premium photo paper and I pay an outrageous sum of money which is sure to end up buying a Britney Spears CD.    So basically all I did this weekend was contribute to Britney's megamillions which supports her lavish lifestyle including trips to Vegas where she marries some poor sap only to divorce him hours later.  It all boils down to the destruction of American marriages and how the Easter bunny at the mall is, at least in some small part, responsible.    Falling prey to the Easter-Bunny-at-the-Mall trap isn't all I did this weekend.  I also dressed my kids up in pastel outfits with little duckies on them and forced bunny ears upon their heads.  Then I put them in various poses and bribed them to smile.  Reilly is easily bribed with candy or some such forbidden sweet.  Roman is harder to bribe.  Basically, I have to flash him a boob since breastmilk is the only thing he eats.  Picture it if you will:  My two kids in bunny ears and me shaking my bazongas and making yummy noises while dangling candy with one hand and snapping pictures with my other.  Yet another example of my maternal holiday insanity.    I also dyed Easter eggs with Reilly Kate.  She has quite the future in egg dying.  Straight away, she picked up an egg, eschewing the dipper and instead used her hands like an eggy Jackson Pollack or something.  Dip in here, dip in there, dip dip dip.  I really thought they'd turn out horribly.  Much to my surprise, however, they looked like a psychodelic, tie dye job.  Really quite colorful.  I watched her carefully for several minutes and tried to imitate her moves.  Every egg I made turned brown and ugly.  It's all in the wrist, I'm sure.  The problem with Reilly Kate and egg dying is really the drying part.  She thinks that once you finish with the dying you then pick up the egg and either throw it on the floor, crack it on the table, or just plain take a big old bite out of it, shell and all.  We now have a dozen beautifully colored but cracked and bitten eggs as well as the dozen ugly brown eggs I made.  We'll be eating a lot of egg salad in the next few days.    I am trying, though, to impart the spiritual meaning of Easter on my kids.  I want them to know that it is more than just giant fuzzy mall bunnies, psychodelic cracked eggs, and Mama's boobs.  Being that it is Palm Sunday, we took the kids to the local Lutheran church.  As I was busily snapping pictures of them in their bunny ears before we left, I must have told her we were going to God's house to see Jesus.  Reilly loves Jesus.  She's a big fan.  When we walked in, Reilly announced, 'Jesus isn't here.  I don't see him.  He's not here.'  I assured her that he was, that indeed this is Jesus' house.  'No, it's not,' she stated most matter of factly, 'I can't see him anywhere!  Where is him?'  'He's up there,' I pointed to the altar.  'He's up by the cross.'  'No, he's NOT!!!  Wheeeeere is heeeeeeeeeee?!?!?!'    She was starting to get agitated at this point and I didn't want to have a scene.  So I said, 'Ask your father.'  Mike answered without even looking up from the hymnal, 'He's thinking.'  Now, I'm not sure if it was Mike who was thinking or if it was Jesus, but it shut Reilly up for the moment which was the goal.  We all settled in and I thought the subject was forgotten about.  However, as soon as the processional began and she caught a glimpse of the pastor, she shouted, 'There he is!! That's Jesus right there!!!'  'No,' I corrected her.  'He works for Jesus.  Jesus is his boss.  Just like you are Mama's boss.'  I let out a little chuckle at my snide witticism, thinking myself quite clever.  She nodded.  She is clear on the concept now.  Jesus is too busy thinking to actually appear in church and pastor is his Mama.   I should have just stuck to eggs, boobs, and bunnies.                 ",female

"           Such a good weekend.  Oftentimes, days and days will go by in which nothing notable happens, and then people ask what I've been up to and all I have to talk about are burritos and reality television.  Well this weekend was the opposite of that--nothing mind-blowing or anything, just good times with good people.  Rather than blather on endlessly, I think I'll break this up into little episodes (who needs those pesky transition sentences anyway?) and throw in some purdy pictures.  * urlLink The Heights .  Ahhh The Heights.  This is one of the two college bars in which I spent way more time than class.  For happy hour on Friday, I met up with L, who is getting up at 4:30 a.m. six days per week this summer to row, and another  urlLink L , who just returned from far off lands.  The man who mixed me countless Long Island Iced Teas freshman year is still bartending so I felt at home, and thanks to a couple of his margaritas I was wasted by 8 p.m.  After a regrettable drunken email or two and a bag of tortilla chips with salsa and cream cheese (it seemed like a good idea at the time) I had to call it a night.  this girl has the best laugh in the world    * urlLink Laicale .  It took me five years to do so, but I've finally found my hair place.   urlLink Bumble  schmumble, Laicale is so much more sane and favorably located.  I also have a weird fascination with my stylist, Brian.  I'd never had a guy cut my hair before, but the first time I went there he was wearing the coolest boots ever and I had to have him next.  We've hardly spoken because I'm all shy and awkward sometimes and he's all sweet and quiet (also, it just seems weird to chat it up with someone who's got a sharp object near your head,) but I know we could be buddies if we, like, talked or something.  thanks, laicale brian    *Afternoon with  urlLink Drone .  Great minds do, indeed, think alike.  With no prior consultation, Drone and I booked appointments at Laicale for the same day, around the same time.  We walked around Soho in between appointments and the East Village afterwards.  The weather Saturday was simply perfect, and illegal to go margaritas combined with the  urlLink informal dog show  in the park made the day even more perfect.  Except for one minor detail...  isn't she lovely?    *El accidente.  After the dog show, I was hungry as usual, so Drone and I went to  urlLink Esperanto  for a cuban sandwich and more margaritas.  While getting up to use the facilities, I sprained my ankle  urlLink Susie -style (i.e., tripping over nothing while attempting to walk under the influence of not that much alcohol.)  It's not as severe as her sprain was, but I have a sexy limp thing going on.  I'm usually quite resposible when it comes to my health, but sometimes I'm like the Black Knight from  urlLink Monty Python and the Holy Grail , who, in case you don't recall, shrieked 'it's only a flesh wound!' as his limbs were being lopped off.  As such, I treated the injured ankle by dancing on it for five hours straight...  dancin' fools    * urlLink Misshapes .  Like the last time I went to this party, 5 a.m. came upon me with no warning.  The night was full of  urlLink friends making out , friends doing things even I am too prude for, friends running into long-lost friends, and a sleazy Spaniard whose hands kept finding their way up my skirt until said friends thankfully intervened (see if you can find him in the photo below.)  Also, I could not hold onto anything.  I remember sending four vodka tonics flying, which means there were probably more than that, and I dropped my 5 a.m. hot dog on myself and woke up Sunday morning smelling like a vodka, mustard, and sauerkraut cocktail.  Yum.  where's waldo?    *Hungover afternoon with Drone.  Miraculously and after much prodding, I managed to drag myself outside on Sunday for a stroll through the West Village.  I'm so glad I did, because not only did we witness a hilarious interaction between a group of homeless men and unfortunately-dressed tourists, but I had one of my best celebrity sitings to date.  Walking near the Marc Jacobs store with a nondescript B-list actor boy in tow was none other than  urlLink Nicky Hilton .  I gawked for a little too long as she walked past me (had to get a good look) and she glared.  She had stringy, jet black hair that was all matted in the back and absurdly tan skin, and, of course, she was way shorter than she looks on TV.  not nicky hilton           ",female
"       To Spanish, or not to Spanish? Every day starting before I arrive at noon and continuing until about one o'clock, myriad day laborers arrive to buy our overly priced lunches.  I usually speak to them in English, as they all have at least a very functional vocabulary specific to a few things, including buying lunch.  There are certain assumptions that one must make for them, including that they will want small a brown bag for their forties and a paper bag to put the six pack in, and, since the whole exercise is so very routine and rote, the exchange is usually not noteworthy.  Today, however, a customer of the hispanic persuasion bought lunch and, upon my giving him the change thanked me with 'Gracias.'  I responded reflexively with 'De nada', and thought nothing of my choice of language, polyglot that I am.  However, I mentioned the exchange to a colleague from Spain whom, do to his fair features, customers not at all unlike the one with whom I had earlier exchanged call 'Gringo.'  So now I wonder if I was being a condescending jerkface when I said that.  Comment time!  Returns Ladies and Gentlemen of this beautiful country of ours, I stress to you that if you do not intend to purchase something, please, please, please do not take it to the checkout counter with you.  I know that you thought that the milk was sour before you picked it up to put it on the belt, and I know that you had no intention of buying you child the 'Finding Nemo' sippy cup, and I know that you had checked how much money you had with you and had heard of sales tax before you came in, and that you already knew how expensive the grocery store where I work is, so why can you not take the forty five seconds to put it back where you found it.  None of the cashiers really shop at this supermarket; it's too expensive.  We shop at Shop Right, Stop & Shop, or The Grand Union.  We don't know where to find the things you picked up and dropped in the returns bin like an unwanted baby on a church step.  So I, with my very limited and not at all specific knowledge of the store layout, nonsensical signs and very contrived and bizarre distinctions between genres of grocery items, set out to return a full cart full of rejects.  The character of the rejected item is, usually, not that of the staple item that you actually write down on your shopping list.  It is unnecessary and thus to be found at the very bottom or top of a shelf, or on the ends of the aisles, or some such.  The quest lasted over an hour, as I have been historically bad at seeing what I am looking for in plain sight.  Another way to consider the plight of the returner is to consider how long it would take you, knowing where you found the item, to replace it, add time it would take the poor, doe-eyed clerk to find its place, and multiply it by about fifty.  That's how much I hate you, you lazy, inconsiderate fool.         ",male

"                 For all intensive purposes the 6  urlLink Third Rail  songs are finally done. I had to actually totally remaster them between yesterday and today. I like the way it sounds now. The band and I will just sit down to look over the stuff to see if there is anything else that needs to be fixed. I'm going to be remastering the original eight tracks also, but that is going to be easy compared to a full blown production.  Other than that Tropical Storm Charley visited the studio this morning around 7:30 AM. What makes this awesome is that I went to bed at 2:30 AM and when the rains started coming down and smacking my air conditioner in my room it was so loud it woke me up. We need the rain around here so Charley was actually welcome in this area.   My father and I have measured about 3.5' of rain in the last two days. Not bad since this is usually our driest part of the year.  Now that I'm pretty much done with the six songs I'm going to clean the studio and play some of my favorite Mozart pieces on the piano.

"       This is a letter from Ray Reynolds, a medic in the Iowa Army National Guard, serving in Iraq:  As I head off to Baghdad for the final weeks of my stay in Iraq, I wanted to say thanks to all of you who did not believe the media. They have done a very poor job of covering everything that has happened.Â  I am sorry that I have not been able to visit all of you during my two week leave back home.Â  And just so you can rest at night knowing something is happening in Iraq that is noteworthy, I thought I would pass this on to you.Â  This is the list of things that has happened in Iraq recently: (Please share it with your friends and compare it to the version that your paper is producing.)  * Over 400,000 kids have up-to-date immunizations. * School attendance is up 80% from levels before the war. * Over 1,500 schools have been renovated and rid of the weapons stored there so education can occur. * The port of Uhm Qasar was renovated so grain can be off-loaded from ships faster. * The country had its first 2 billion barrel export of oil in August. * Over 4.5 million people have clean drinking water for the first time ever in Iraq. * The country now receives 2 times the electrical power it did before the war. * 100% of the hospitals are open and fully staffed, compared to 35% before the war. * Elections are taking place in every major city, and city councils are in place. * Sewer and water lines are installed in every major city. * Over 60,000 police are patrolling the streets. * Over 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police are securing the country. * Over 80,000 Iraqi soldiers are patrolling the streets side by side with US soldiers. * Over 400,000 people have telephones for the first time ever. * Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs. * An interim constitution has been signed. * Girls are allowed to attend school. * Textbooks that don't mention Saddam are in the schools for the first time in 30 years.  Don't believe for one second that these people do not want us there. I have met many, many people from Iraq that want us there, and in a bad way. They say they will never see the freedoms we talk about but they hope their children will.Â  We are doing a good job in Iraq and I challenge anyone, anywhere to dispute me on these facts.Â  So If you happen to run into John Kerry, be sure to give him my email address and send him to Denison, Iowa. This soldier will set him straight. If you are like me and very disgusted with how this period of rebuilding has been portrayed, email this to a friend and let them know there are good things happening.

"        urlLink    This was spray painted on the wall of a gas station in Montreal.  Maybe the poor spelling is due to a language barrier.  Maybe it's due to the fact that a lot of punks and wanna be activists are just retarded.  I'm interpreting this act of vandalism to mean that 'Irak' is the 'new adminitration' for the gas station.  I understand that Iraq does possess a large amount of oil.  I also understand that the states and other countries require it for gas and such.  But I do think the proper (fashionable?) thing to do is protest the United States, their arrogance, their president, his administration and their motives for the war in Iraq.    Wouldn't if be better to spray paint 'US controlled oil, paid for with blood' or something a little more anti-American and not so anti-Iraq?  Roughly ten thousand Iraqis have been killed while only around one thousand people from every other country involved have died.  When you look at that ratio it's obvious that Iraq is being dominated.  It's unfortunate that so many people are dying for nothing.    So it goes.  Maybe I expect too much from activists and people who feel the need to spray paint virtually meaningless slogans on gas stations.  Maybe that's why I'm feeling frustrated.  But is it honestly too much to ask that they spell relatively simple words correctly?  I mean seriously, administration is spelled exactly how it sounds.  Ad-min-is-tra-tion.  Come on.  Usually I'm fairly apathetic, but lately I have begun to feel a little more socially conscious, at least on a very small level.  Either that or I'm just fed up with my landlord, I'm not sure which one yet.  The lack of hot water in my decrepit apartment building didn't end until this afternoon.  That's almost two weeks.  I wrote a few days ago that 'average people deserve to be informed before signing a lease with an indifferent management company who can't even provide a basic service like hot water' and I believe that.  So here's a picture of my attempt to caution those who are in a position to wind up living in slight discomfort.  This is written right by the building entrance near the 'for rent' sign.  Hopefully people will see this warning and take heed.  If potential tenants are discouraged to move in, the landlord could lose some money, and I think that would be just fine.  Fight the power.   urlLink             ",male
"       In an effort to expand my musical horizons I asked my friend Kate to share some of her favourite music with me.  She has always been a music lover... it's why we get along so well.  But since I left Toronto over two years ago, she strayed away from her old I-like-everything attitude, into this Punk Revival genre, and now it's all she listens to.  I am certainly not criticizing her; in fact I think it's admirable that she has found a niche that she truly loves and that probably makes her happy.  So I asked her to help me with this post.  She gave me three of her favuorite bands, and recommended two songs from each of them.  Then she was supposed to find me pictures for each band, and help me write about them, but she disappeared on me *cough*cop-out*cough*.

"       I've subscribed to Netflix.  I can't help but wonder why I hadn't done this earlier.  Netflix is ideal for someone like me.  Before signing up, I attained membership cards in two Los Angeles video rental place dealie thingies - first, a Hollywood Video.  (A Hollywood Video in LA?  Who'd a thunk it?)   And then I got a membership in a place that's right around the corner from my apartment.  The Hollywood Video is on the corner of Western and Santa Monica, which is a 15 minute drive from my place when traffic is bad.  And since I'm really ultra super lazy about things like returning videos, unless the place is within walking distance like the second store I mentioned, I'm going to accrue late fees.  Which is exactly what happened.  Hell, I almost returned movies to the place around the corner late, which should really show how bad I am with these things.  But now I'm a Netflix member.  Movies come to me, and when I'm done I just pop them into a envelope, sans stamp, and mail it back for my next selection.  Speaking of selection, the reason I signed up to Netflix without really mulling it over was because of its selection.  I've been meaning to watch more anime, samurai films, films by Akira Kurosawa, and more foreign films in general.  Netflix has just about every single freakin' movie I've had on my mental things-I've-gotta-watch-list.  That rules.  My first 8 selections are the 8 DVDs that cover the entire Neon Genesis: Evangelion series, not including the two Neon Genesis movies.  After that, I go into a couple Kurosawa films, a couple of Miyazaki animes I hadn't seen, then random schtuff I've been meaning to watch.

"             According to a  New York Times   urlLink article , an anti-war group was prevented, by Clear Channel Communications, from placing an ad on a billboard to be shown during the Republican Convention in New York City.  The ad was to read, 'Democracy Is Best Taught by Example, Not by War.'  Clear Channel, apparently, backed out of a leasing deal, with the group, that had been reached last December.  Clear Channel says that it has no political agenda, and only object to the bomb imagery in the ad, a cartoon like bomb is shown lit with the message underneath, but, it sures seems convenient to deny an ad that is to be shown during the Republican convention, that is also objecting to Bush's war.  This attack on free speech and attempted censorship isn't anything new to Clear Channel, however.  They censored the Dixie Chicks, only after they spoke out against Bush, and they censored Howard Stern, only after he began to speak out against Bush.  Is Clear Channel playing politics?  Seems pretty obvious to me.         ",male

I am enjoying myself a lot and have no complaints. Hey, things are going really well. The lecturers and the school in general seem to treat us different. They tell us, 'So  YOUR  the aeronautical engoneering students right?(duh!) Well then, i expect more from you guys!(what??!!!) 11pts average right?(so what??).' We soon found out expecting more meant literally flying through the lecture notes and tutorials and lab work... i must say its quite exciting that everyday we learn so much and for some reason, we havent been bogged down with homework, projects, assignments, difficult tests or demanding lecturers. I mean our lecturers would go through the chapter quite fast and give us a few questions to do... That's it! Anyhow... i have waited a year for this(laughs) and in one week...&nbsp; YAY!!!!

"                 hey, peeps.  you know what, my dear reader my friend?  i love you.  that might sound corny and/or weird and/or unrealistic, but really properly analyzed it's not.  i love all living beings on general principles.  and i recommend that as a good way to be.  what does it mean that i love you, even not particularly knowing you well?  it means that i recognize you as a precious living being, deserving of happiness and its causes and deserving to overcome suffering completely.  it doesn't mean i know you personally and approve of your every characteristic.  i don't have to to love you as i do.  i wish you every happiness and no suffering at all.  a word of advice:  avoid malice like the plague.  i've decided that malice is the root cause of every suffering.  don't invest yourself in malice, even in subtle ways.  and don't fear malice.  by that i mean neither be afraid of (fear) malice nor obey (fear) malice.  and by malice i mean the wish and/or intention that someone suffer, in whatever way in whatever degree, be that yourself or someone else.  never punish yourself, cause that's a form of malice and you'll suffer for it.  and *noone* deserves to suffer.  dangerous people deserve to be quarantined so they don't harm people, but they don't deserve to be punished in the sense of being made to suffer.  imagine what the world would be like without any malice at all!  seriously, imagine it.  think about it.  invest your energy like that into making the world free from malice.  even those *thoughts* actually help, i promise!  thought power is a very real thing, and it has a greater effect upon oneself and others than most of us have been trained to imagine.  use it well.  use it joyfully to abandon malice in all of its forms.  i *promise* you you'll be making good karma that way and *will* be rewarded.  invest yourself well into the abandonment of malice and you'll be rewarded mightily.  this is no exaggeration.  the reward might take a while to reach you, but it *will* come.  this is a total promise.  we *can* eliminate malice, and we *will* eliminate malice.  this is a vow of mine as well as a promise.  so, dear reader dear friend, remember that i love you.  and write to me if you need a friend, 'cause i vow that i'll be as good a friend to you as circumstances make practical.  l8rz...

"            For the past   5 days, I have   been battered to a black and blue Jennifer. Wednesday, volleyball camp started. Although I was siked to start the season, I was a bit dicey when it came to the new coaching staff. Our head coach, Amber, and her assistant, Jess, are both 24 year old recent graduates of Alderson Broadus. When sports teams have a two week window in June when they can practice, we worked our butts off learning a new defense. Instead of running the defensive rotation that has been pounded into our heads since freshman year, we are now told to do the complete opposite. It might actually work if everyone on the team knew what was going on, but when we get out on the court everything falls apart. It doesn't look good.    After camp ended at 4pm everyday, I raced home to quickly take a shower. As fast as I could, I would eat a small dinner and head to work. I seriously almost fell asleep at work one day. Working till 9 each night, then going to bed at 10 is not my idea of a cool summer. I've missed Footloose, my friends, my family, and meals.    I've just now started to recover from this volleyball-then-work life. But guess what! I can't write anymore right now because I must be at work in 15 minutes.     &nbsp;   Current Mood - Where's my Starbucks doubleshot expresso?     &nbsp;   Currently Playing - 'Eye of the Tiger' - the one in the Starbucks commercial.

"             Good day today. I got up about 7:45 to a sky of pouring rain thinking that soccer practice would be cancelled, but boy was I wrong. I told the team co-ordinator Laura that I wasn't going to play but I did want to go down there to get our kit sorted out and find out what team I would be on and all that stuff. It was raining much to hard for me to risk catching a cold to suit them. But I'm excited!!! We have a good team and the shorts and socks like really good together. Now we only have to find the shirts.  I came home and started reading the first Harry Potter book. I fell asleep after page 10, I hope that's not a sign of how the rest of the reading is going to go. I saw the movie so I know the plot line already although I know the book will be much more specific...we'll see.  Tonight I went to Maman Pumpkin's which is a excellent Indian restaurant with Hazel, Terry, and Chris. It was Hazel's birthday and that's her favorite place to eat. Its very good, but very spicy so I always have to get something off the baby menu so my mouth doesn't burn up! We had a great dinner and finished it up with Indian cha, which is a spicy sort of tea. Its really good too. After dinner, we went to the Sports Cafe for drinks (I had soda) and playing pool. I suck at pool but I'm getting better each time. I guess that's the only way you really learn.  As I was going to my car after leaving the cafe' I saw a girl Nilta that I'd met when I was with Sanae last week. I was waving at her and she didn't recognize me, but the other two looked so happy to see me that I got out of the car and started talking with them and exchanging information almost immediately. The two other people ended up being Aru (Brazilian guy who speaks English just like I do) and Keysha (a Black girl from Pennsylvania).  It was about midnight when I got back to my car where they were walking past, and I stayed out there and talked to them until about 1:50am! Nilta actually left about 10 minutes after I met them but Aru, Keysha, and I just stayed on the street and talked and talked. I was quite fun! We have made a date for them to come up to my place and have a sleep over, cook dinner and watch movies. I'm excited about all this, but it won't be for another week or so before they come up. We wanted to do it on a long weekend when we didn't have to go to work on Monday and I think the next one is October 14th. I really hope we keep in touch. Keysha has natural hair too and its much longer than mine so I'm sure I can help her out with braids and stuff...for a minimal cost that is. Aru has many people in his family that used relaxers and knows how to put one in so if I break down and have to get one, at least I know someone who is near me that can put it in!   This has been a pretty good day. I have my Japanese lesson tomorrow at 4:30 and still have yet to write the 1/2 page journal that Natusko asked me to write. I did work on the other homework she gave me though. I will get up semi-early tomorrow and work on it. I do want to be a dedicated student. Off to sleepy land. :)         ",female

"        (Another journal entry transferred. I had only written in it a couple times.)   mm, writing in this thing again? Well I mean I only took a year off (minus one day)... So anyways, wow, I'm still with Taylor so that's pretty sweet. Though somne things are aggrevating. I love him, but gras! So he's been gone (like last summer) since july 1st, in CO. It's a good opportunity and experience and such for him but it's really annoying for me. We talk on the phone when we can, but it's really not enough. We're both lonely and get depressed and it's just stupid. Last night he cut himself for the first time. What a little hypocrite. All the time explaining how it's against him etc. to do that. He's like the reason I stopped. And now he starts. Fuck that- it makes my counting on his strength and using that as inspiration and such worthless. Well whatever, I'm better than that. I'm better than the people who need that. I can stop whenever I want, thant's another reason I did stop, I don't want to put myself in the same category as the pathetic souls who 'need to hurt themselves to distract from the pain of life.' Bah. I realized- deal with it! Life sucks, whatever, get used to it dammit. And although on occasion I have a sort of slip (like in a fight with someone I scratch myself, etc.) I still have grown up enough to deal with sadness in other ways. Stupid taylor. I mean I know what he was feeling, last week I had a little breakdown of sorts myself. I just needed to talk to him, but the thing was, he wasnt there for me. I tried so hard to be there for him, console him, etc. but it seemed as if he didn't want me to try to help or reassure him of my love, so im not sure what to do. I'm kind of pissed off about he's handled this being away thing. Not calling really, not being very considerate, etc. I do love him, but I guess this is one of the reasons it's good we're breaking up next year. Maybe someday I'll find someone who really treats me like a goddess. I'm so shallow because I basically want a guy like Jon Woodside, but one who's more attractive. He 's so good to me, but he's justnot my type physically, so i guess that's the way it goes. Tay is fun, but he's definitely not my dream guy. He's hot, he's fun, and he can be sweet, but he doesn't sweep me off my feet. He doesn't make me feel like I'm a queen. He does do some nice things sometimes.... and sometimes he compliments me.... but I always feel like Im being judged. And when I ask if he thinks I'm pretty and he says 'well, i think you could use a diet.' then I feel pretty bad abouit myself. I suppose I should, he is telling the truth, but still, I do wish he didn't think that. I wish he just thought I was beautiful how I am. Oh well though, whatever. Other things are kinda getting to me lately too. I'm not close with anyone really (besides him), my acting career is at a standstill, SLOTH is dead, Selfism is dead, etc. Even the things I used to do like keeping a journal I can't do now because of what happened with my mom. The person I used to be is slowly dying it seems and it upsets me. So what do I do? Rebel against everything and just try to start over? But the thing is, sometimes I am happy, I just wish it was more often. bah, perhaps I'll write again soon. At least this is somewhere my mom and people I know can never find.          ",female

"        WASHINGTON ( urlLink Reuters ) - The U.S. Army has charged four soldiers, three of them with manslaughter, after the drowning of an Iraqi prisoner who was pushed off a bridge, while a senior general criticized U.S. military detention policies, officials said on Friday.  The soldiers, on patrol near the city of Samarra 60 miles north of Baghdad on Jan. 3, pushed two Iraqis off a bridge at nighttime into the Tigris River after picking up the men on a curfew violation, officials said. One Iraqi drowned, while the other got out of the river.    This is truly scary shit. I don't understand why our troops are so hostile to the civilians over there. It usually means extremely low morale, which would make sense because of all the factors like car bombings, the  urlLink involuntary call to service , being lied to about the motives for being sent to war, etc.  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Interesting news at  urlLink Reuters : The pace of job growth has 'slowed sharply in June' as less than half of the predicted number of jobs were created. In fact, the 'manufacturing sector lost 11,000 jobs.' Many predict a 'leveling off in the pace of the economy' while the boom in number of jobs is a sign of lower corporate profits. Some say there are good signs of the economy getting better, but this might just be the aristocracy talking. One should remember that the actual quality of the job market has declined significantly with the boom in jobs. It was noticed that 'that wages are not keeping up with the costs that people are facing' and the increase of jobs has actually caused the average workweek to get shorter, back to where it was in December. It's uncertain if the decline in growth will continue, but the changes seen so far have fallen short of greatness.   Also, for the first time in 4 years, 'the U.S. central bank raised official interest rates a quarter percentage point on Wednesday.'   GM is reported to have 'double-digit declines in their U.S. sales during June, a drag on the economy not only because automakers are big employers but also major users of materials for manufacturing.' The rise in energy prices is probably the most significant factor, especially considering the hike in gas prices recently.     ",male

I used to take him running with me when he was a pup, and i think i may have scarred him for life.  He loves to go for walks (insists on carrying his leash himself) but if i start running, he'll get about three steps and then just sits the fuck down.  He weighs just under 120 pounds now, so its not good for your shoulder when he quits.  He just flat refuses to move.  If you try and get him to stand up, he lays down and rolls over on his back.  This can be a bit embarrassing - people driving by and me trying to drag a 120 pound 'Rotweiler' who is laying on his back with his feet in the air.  'What is that guy doing to that poor dog?

Some years later they met again. The Father asked, 'Well  now, Mrs. Donovan, how are ye these days?'  She replied, 'Oh, very well, Father!' The Father asked, 'And tell me, have ye any wee ones yet?'

"           This Post (09/03/03)This time around, Next time around. When do you know that somehow you have to be organised, that somehow you figured it all out and that you can see the clear picture, the true meaning of your life? Is it now? Hello? Is that you Maturity? When do you know? When do you stop getting hit in the face with Life's 'little cliche'd suprises'? I feel too tired to be rebellious, and when I say that I realise I'm too melodramatic for my own fucking good. Scratch that. Reverse. I'm too tired to actually have the energy to say to people, my god, are you not seeing this? To me, you have to be a walking talking responsibility to actually live your life through the truth ... and is that the same to you? Dumbfuck? I was outside the hospital, a hospital last night, around this time, yeah I'm pretty sure it was yesterday, me and Been were about to toke our last stash when Been decides to check on V, but you know my sister hasn't been feeling very well these last couple of weeks. She believes all life is a dirty black wash, that she is nothing but a vaccummed soul full of razor sharp hurt, that no-one can understand just how much pain she feels, that it's just so damn hard to wake up in the morning and be dissapointed, in just how much life fucking sucks.  Boo fucking Hoo. Yeah, perhaps that was too harsh. As she said 'Are you going to treat me like shit then?' No. I replied...but then again I have a real good reason to be extremely non tolerant of stuff like that. It was my childhood, my adolecent years, and now if you push me into that fucking emotional Jaws scenario, I am terrified I am going to sink into it so quick and so deep that people will let me die due to sympathy. 'Holy Hell, just let her DIE already!' Personally I know that I have more reason to be miserable than she does, if the 'Society' manual is anything to go by, I'm unemployed, with a worthless University Degree, and a drug habit. But in the real human emotion world, where there is no manual, she perhaps is worse of than me, thank god for Strenght and balanced Serotonin. It took me a couple of years to realise just how much I don't give a fuck what people believe about me. Anyways, to the point. I was standing there, freezing because I was in my pyjama mode, watching Been freak out when she realised that we had an overdose on our hands, and well yadda yadda, gotta leave some shit out because apparently it's 'private'. But the thing is...Why do you not live your beliefs? If life is so hard why don't you change it? Yeah so it's hard, it's hard to watch your life be controlled, but that's when you have to get the hell out and change it. That's the evil side to being able to see through the black paint that the media pushes at us on a millisecond basis, it's up to you to change it. Now, perhaps she doesn't see it, perhaps she has swallowed the lie, perhaps she has an idea on how everything is supposed to work. Is it working? I didn't think so. 'Who are you? Who? I really wanna know' - The Who         ",female
"            Meanwhile, in another story happening elsewhere involving different characters entirely...   For the nth time that day, Government Documents Librarian II Whatsername Sprank (real first name Magda) checked the area to make sure she was alone, opened the tiny window of the media player on the desk computer and stole company time like a wicked bandit by watching the news clip again. The Japanese scientist pushed the adorable little  urlLink robot .  The little robot fell down.  'I feel very bad about this,' the Japanese scientist said, in Japanese.  Sprank did not really speak Japanese, but she could lip read it perfectly after years and years of watching Godzilla movies dubbed into English.  The adorable little robot struggled for a moment and then got adorably back up, with approximately as much heart-liquifyingly adorable lack of grace as a curly-haired human toddler or perhaps a big-eyed monkey baby.  It said something in a metallically adorable robot voice and then went over to give the Scientist a hug.  Sprank imagined the scientist looked a little abashed at such puppy-like forgiveness, even if the shove had been part of the demonstration drill required for the press conference.  A same-faced chorus of bespectacled and white coated scientists said, 'awwww,' as did the crush of robot-loving Japanese press that filled the demonstration room, most of them were off camera.  Sprank wanted to know what the robot had said.  She'd watched the video clip 23 times since the link had appeared on the wire three hours ago at who knew what hour Tokyo time.  This time she thought she had a pretty good transliteration so she plugged it into a randomly selected  urlLink translator  webpage.  She got back: 'Robot descend no ouchie.  Upright super cowboy, OK super fine!  I love you.' Sprank had a laugh like someone just slapped a donkey and she amused herself listening to her braying echo off the walls of the Apse, as this solemn little rarely visited wing of the university library was known.  Robots are funny.  She wished she had $54,000 so she could buy one.   Sprank, on the books at least, made poverty wages.  If it were not for the monthly transfers from her father's secret offshore account, she would have no money at all for the toast, gummy candy and spinach that sustained her vital life force.  Or for her handbag habit.  A robot would definitely fall under the heading of 'conspicuous consumption' and might blow her cover with the rest of the library staff.  She couldn't lose this cover now, she and Romeo were so close to busting open a major LARVAE conspiracy, he'd have her hide if she lost this secret identity day job.  Plus, it had the added benefit of being in such a forbidding corner of the library that she got to fulfill her public service desk duties while only rarely having to deal with one of those filthy annoying members of the general public.

"             I can see the Chicago Tribune Headline now:   Man Mobbed While Transporting Veggies   Chicago, (AP)- A man was transporting vegetables by plastic container with dip. He had a bottle vodka which created a frenzy on the 12:15 train to Valparaiso. One bystander said, 'It was craziness man, they just all started going for his pocket!'.  The victim, an unidentified male, was unharmed but appeared distraut and disoriented. One of the mobbers tipped the tray from his arms causing carrots and cherry tomatoes to roll down the train car aisle. It also catapulted the dip into the air landing on a small child. The mob created such commotion that the bottle of vodka crashed to the train floor and broke. The toxic mixture of the dip fumes mixed with that of the vodka left many with an unidentified rash on their skin. The CDC spokesperson, Ima Scratcher, said 'We haven't identified the rash yet, but we believe it to be a rapidly spreading, but short lived virus'   Future reports will be relayed.

And i know you cant just get over your ex but i just wanted to know.  because if you were i was hoping me and you could go do something together. and if you are ready maybe we could go out.

"       The Lilian Baylis School in Kennington has become the first school in the country to ban slang speech in lessons.

As the  urlLink BBC made a big deal of , head teacher Gary Phillips feels 'pupils need to be proficient in both spoken and written English to pass exams.'  If a pupil does use a slang word in class,  'the teacher corrects it on the board and gives the standard English phrase. They then put a tick next to the slang each time it is repeated to show how often students slip into the habit.'   The best bit: Student Nicholas Harris told BBC London about his experience of the scheme. He said:  'It is hard because the people I hang around with always use slang.

"           Death of a Salesman...  Moving to Detroit I brought almost every material item of mine.  TV, Computer, Bedding, clothing, and the list goes on.  What I still have a hard time understanding is why I brought a shovel.  Still there it is, leaning against the side on the cracked painted house of 1900 Brockton.  It's your typical shovel with a large wooden handle and a metal spade with dried dirt on it.  After the first week of training I went to our small back yard and broke the ground with it.  With a solid push it broke the surface.  Some grass turned over and small pile of dirt started to form.  Weeks would go on and a good size hole started to form.  The pile of dirt grew larger.    I haven't liked my job from day one.  Whenever I buy a new book it's safe to say I'm going to find a NYC bestseller.  Like most people I look at the cover, whatever grabs my attention.  However there have been some books I've read where the cover didn't intrigue me, but the story that resulted was one that never had dog eared corners.  I was constantly turning the pages.  I knew I couldn't judge a job by the first day or the first week.  Still, time doesn't stop, it moves on and so do we.  As time progressed my opinion held strong.  It did not waver, but like a flag in the wind was outstretched.  My head was telling me all the reasons I was unhappy.  Leaving friends, leaving family, leaving a lifestyle I was accustomed too.  Still now and then we need to stop listening to our head and listen with our hearts.  My heart beats regulary and much like the life sustaining beat it tells me day in day out that this isn't the place for me.  Maybe someday in the future my heart will say Detroit and the automotive industry.  In the meantime it is beating to a different rhythm.  A beat I can feel deep inside me, a beat that I am trying to find the source of.    Two months have passed here in the Midwest.  Two months of learning.  This coming weekend I am following my heart.  I am boarding a plane to Texas.  I am pursuing a different career.  There is a chance that I won't get hired.  A very likely chance and that is a fact that scares me right to my core.  I am confident in what I can achieve, yet sometimes no matter what effort we put in the results come out to our disliking.    In the meantime you can find me in the backyard digging.  Every passing day the guilt inside me grows.  Ford will recover the financial cost of one David John Hoffman or company id dhoffm38.  There have been co-workers who have effected my life and now ones I have effected.  There is a trust relationship.  A relationship in which great work is expected now and into the foreseable future.  I have started to measure my future in weeks and no longer the years that I thought moving here.  The guilt is crushing me.  The longer I stay the deeper the hole.  I've dug myself deep enough that it's becoming hard to see the top.  This metaphorical hole is now 6 feet deep.  While I'm not dead, this guilt is killing me.           ",male

"    urlLink Several Ideas to Help 4th Grade Students Learn About the Library.  Here is a lesson plan from  urlLink LibraryInstruction.Com . I am including the entire lesson here with permission.  It gives some good examples how to teach elementary school students library concepts.  It was written by Maxine Bonneau.  Lesson:  'When my 4th grade students go to their weekly library class, I have a set topic for them to investigate. In September, with the Rocks & Minerals unit, they each pulled out two pieces of paper at random and looked up a rock and a mineral or gem in the encyclopedias. Another lesson had them look up Pilgrims and Native Americans to read about the first Thanksgiving for a play they were to write themselves. (We put it on the day before Thanksgiving in four acts!) Another great search was for famous composers. Once again, I had them pick two composers from a basket of names. They had to take notes on the composers, making sure they had a famous work (or works,) the birth & death dates, the country of origin, and what kind of instruments they played, if possible. After they had gathered the info from Encyclopedias and non-fiction books, they wrote reports of two paragraphs each on each composer. One paragraph about the composer's life, the other about their music. Then they created posters about them and presented them to the class. Next, we'll be researching Thailand for our upcoming International Day. Our school library is limited, so I encourage the students to visit the public library and get library cards. I give 5 bonus points to students who show me their library cards. The month of Jan. will also be their month for reading a biography for a book report. The book can be found at school or in the public library. This is a good time to introduce the Dewey Decimal System, showing them the categories and locating which category would include a biography about a famous person. The internet research sites such as Yahooligans, etc. can provide additional places for research and opportunities to print out pictures, maps, etc. for reports. The ed. sites show them how to locate appropriate categories and how to narrow down the search. The Encyclopedia Index book is invaluable for this search also. And they also have an incentive for exploring the card catalog to find their assigned topics I give them from each unit. The whole concept of a search mission or a mystery location adventure all add to the excitement of discovering the information they need to add to the class' understanding. We're all in the hunt together.'  Source:   urlLink http://www.libraryinstruction.com/4thgrade.html .  ",male

"           Good Monday friends.   my sectional couch is 75% finished. I've been trying to trim up my belly for getting married.   other than that, I hate the television.   My apartment is nice. I do like it, but it's kinda dark. and really quiet, and just a bit lonely. So the easiest solution is to press that little button and turn on that little box. I don't even like TV. I don't like the programming, I don't like the commercials. Every once and a while  Bart or conan will make me laugh, but really, its such a waste of peace.   I've done fine without it before. For years at a time even. I should put it in the storage locker. I need to find the storage locker first though.   Amy and I have been doing pre-marital counseling with mike and sue B. It's nifty and informal, but also helpful. I'm really sold on doing consoling into our marriage too.   I think that I like the nature of our small church in a lot of ways. But make no mistake, there are many things that become notable more difficult.   For instance, hearing a teaching. A lot can be said for a gifted preacher explaining the bible. I think I'm just starting to get to a point where I can appreciate this type of informational  transfer. Not to say there's no teaching where I am, but there is a homoginy about the age and background of our little church that makes wisdom and experience a valuable commodity.   I don't want to sound like I'm down on small churches.  It's just that I've been doing it for a couple of years now in different forms and one thing I end up missing is being taught from the bible.   I guess that's related to marriage counseling in my mind in the following way. There is a way that the Holy Spirit can get a hold of your heart when you're exposed to the teaching of God's Word. Without the counsel that that brings to an individual, I suppose the next best thing (and the best thing in its own right) is marriage counseling.   I really desire to broaden my perspective from foolishness to wisdom. All the more reason I should find that storage locker, gently place the TV. In it and just try to turn my dark, lonely apartment into a place of peace and rest where I can read God's word and He can, in turn expand my worldview from foolishness to wisdom.            ",male

"           This should be a long post.  Read only if you care to.  I actually don't expect anyone to really enjoy these entries, as I do not plan on reading them until I grow old.  I feel when I am in the 70's with graying hair(that is if I have hair) I will look back and see the world I did when I was 22.  I wonder if I will view it the same.  Long trains, short trains, day trains night trains, taxis, trams, chairlifts, subways, and busses.  This is my journey of the past 10 days filled with sights, stories, and small things that interetested me.  I long for a computer in my dorm room.  While it is good to go outside, I miss the comfort of TV or music on and being able to hop on the internet to surf or email.  I haven't used IM for more than 10 minutes since I've been here and that was early February.  So here I am now at library.  I must say it always feels good coming back to Maastricht.  Especially this time around.  I have been on trains straight for the last 22 hours.  Clean shaven, nails clipped, and smelling like a soap I try not to smile as my lips are chapped and crack.  Its hard not to.  Wednesday the 2nd, head to Innsbruck, Austria alone(I would meet up with friends in the Czek later).  I was taking a night train through Germany.  I met a guy from California.  We talked awhile, but he departed in Cologne, spelled Koln in Germany(I wonder who decided to change spellings for the English).  So now I am in this small car, that during the day would hold 6 passengers on a busy trip.  The car is empty and I prepare myself for sleep.  Sleep did not come over me quick and swiftly as  it usually does.  I stared at the small door and the curtain drawn over it with open eyes.  I heard foot steps and watched as shadows danced in front of me.  A ballet of sorts I didn't care to see.  Images in my head appeared.  Usually with a guy and a knife.  Images associated from Hollywood and the like.  I feel asleep eventually and would be awoken by 3 Swiss boys in their mid teens.  They were going all the way to Munich, the same station where I was to switch trains.  I no longer could lie down, but would hope they would go to sleep.  Quite the opposite.  They decided to take bottles out of their pack and drink.  One passed out and had a hard time waking up.  That Thursday I got into Innsbruck.  I wanted to just drop my stuff off at the hostel.  Actually I wanted to take a nap but wouldn't be allowed to check in till 5pm.  I followed the directions I was given.  But when I was to switch busses the one I needed was not on the street it was suppose to be on.  Armed with a map, I found my way.  So that day I walked around Innsbruck.  I would have liked to have seen the mountains, but it was cloudy in the higher elevations.  With nothing to see, I walked around aimlessly for over 8 hours.  A hightlight was going to McDonalds and just sitting down and reading a book.  It was a way for me to get out of the rain.  Next morning I went skiing.  I went to the nicer mountain and the snow couldn't have been better.  Tons of fluff, sometimes as deep as my knees.  I rented gear including gloves and pants, but they did not have goggles or sun glasses to borrow.  I damaged my eyes to say the least.  I don't know why they were blood shot.  Poor visibility, staring at white all day, snow and ice hitting them, or the occasional sun.    All I can is that they were red.  Eventually they cleared up.  Still I can now say I skiied the alps.  One more thing on my life long list I can check off.  A few others include owning a convertible, sky diving, and having a family.  The next day I was to meet up with my friends at 7 in Prague.  The earliest I could get in was just 10 past 7.  I hoped they would still be in the room.  Now I have a train pass that is good in Austria, but in Czeck.  My plan, get to the border town, buy a ticket.  Actualallity was quite different.  I tried to buy a ticket, but Austrians said I would have to buy it from the Czeck.  I didn't have their currency, but hoped euros would work.  I met a mother and daughter from Arizone, and she said good luck because she had been kicked of before.  Well my pass worked.  They didn't pay close enough attention to it.  I can't explain how relieved I felt, and how this act would cause me to commit other such acts, some would fail.  Now this train was small and the worst one I've ridden in yet.  I can't believe I got there, as I was sure the chickens and goats through my window were laughing, knowing they could beat this mechanical beast in a race.  I arrived into Prague.  This might be the first time I truly felt lost.  I hadn't looked up where the train station was or where the hostel was in comparison(another reason for a computer in the dorms, easy access to researching trips).  I tried to find an ATM, but with no luck exchanged currency instead.  I'm sure the rate wasn't that great.  I decide to go ahead and take a  taxi.  This car had no safety belts, I noticed the speedometer didn't work, but the driver seemed to know his way through the cobblestone roads.  Tackling them with grace, it made me long for my car.  Driving, something I hope will never be taken away from me.  I don't want to go into detail about Prague.  I saw the clock, went to a Communist musuem & Natural history museum, took a walking tour, saw Prague Castle, Jewish Ghetto, and old town square.  The city is beautiful, food ok.  Just try and not pay attention to all the tourist shops that are more present than the McDonalds and the KFCs.  I saw an acoustic guitar performance.  They  played songs by Vivaldi, Bach and the sorts.  Truly a great show, and one made all the more interesting when being played in a church.  I bought a CD of it, my first souvineir purchase.  Don Gionvani.  An opera Mozart created for the people of Prague.  The people I were with wanted to see a marionette show of it.  I was guessing it was a good tourist trap.  The stage would be in someones basement and us sitting on bean bag chairs.  Close enough, it was in an attic.  I wonder how hard it is to control these puppets.  Watching them clumsly walk around stage I feel I could do better....even at the young age of 6.  The music and plot were entertaining though.    I thought Amsterdam was forward with sex. Ok, it is.  But I would have prostitues come straight up to me in Prague and start talking in English. Which brings me to one quick point.  Why is it always beggars and crazy people I meet speak English.  So now these hookers were trying to get me to purchase a service  I had no desire in.  One even grabbed my ass and said sex discount.  I wondered if the ass grab was an attempt to get my wallet.  A wallet safely secured in my front zipped pocket of my jacket.  I must add here that the weather in Prague was miserable.  Some of the coldest weather I've experinced in europe.  One night, we had a guys night out and decided to go to the Cabaret close to the hostel.  This was my first strip club experience, and I can also see it being my last.  I'll admit the girls were beautiful.  It was also cheap and a different scene than I had expected.  They just dance and no one throws them money.  For some reason I seemed to be the popular one there.  Several strippers would get of the stage and give me a short lap dance.  I wondered why they didn't go for my friends next to me for their lap was just as available as the next.  So now most guys would love this, I didn't care for it.  If the lights had been turned on Im sure my face would have been as red as the bricks on the wall because of embarresment.  If you like, you can go downstairs for a private show.  So after the dancing the strippers would mingle with the crowd to help convince you to purchase such services.  3 out of 8 in my group did, I turned the offer down.  The next day were to take a bus to another Czec town.  However the planner of the trip couldn't figure it out.  I need to bring to attention the fact that I was excited of meeting up with group in Prague.  I didn't want to be in control of knowing where to get to places and etc.  In the end I realizd relying on such people will get you no where literally.  That day I spent in Prague discovering it on my own.  A group was a diverse group, but a numerous amount were from Korea.  American is very much indiviualistic as many times I tried to get the group to split up so everyone could be happying doing what they wanted to.  To them a group consensus was a neccessity, one that would lead us no where.  Anyways, I also found bookstores with English dialogue.  I purchased 6 books.  I also hurridly wrote down other titles I would like to read, but didn't want to carry them around for the time being.  I've realized if I dont write down what crosses my mind that instance it will quickly be lost for my mind is continually busseling with thoughts.  I also keep a list of songs I want to download when I get home.  Next stop Shittybest, I mean Budapest, but it is shitty.  That too was a night train.  One in which sleep was often broken because of crossing borders and having passports and tickets checked.  Made for a long night.  And this has made for a long entry.  I shall continue on tomorrow.         ",male

"                 There's that moment of panic when you realize you've messed something up, and it's totally your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it.  In a way that's a cool feeling -- in the same way that sometimes any feeling is a cool feeling, better than no feeling at all, and just gets the adrenaline pumping in a way that feels kind of invigorating every so often.  And I guess I'm talking needless panicking -- because panicking about real, actual, serious mistakes (oops, the scalpel shouldn't have gone that deep!) is not cool on any level, and even mistakes that aren't life or death, but fire-able offense kind of mistakes -- I don't know what that is at a law firm... falsifying information?  I don't know enough to name a laundry list of these things.  All this is to lead up to a silly little anecdote about a stupid mistake I made this afternoon that at the moment I realized it felt pretty disastrous, but that was just the adrenaline response, and then I realized it was just a stupid little mistake, and I'll probably survive.  Basically, I was working on the fourth draft of something, and accidentally e-mailed the initial rough draft out as the 'latest version' reflecting all corrections -- I'd saved it in a different file and clicked on the wrong one to attach -- and then got back a whole set of comments that were in large part repeats of comments I'd already seen -- because the old draft didn't have them corrected like the new draft did.  So when I got it back, I panicked.  'So now the partner must think I'm too stupid to make the changes he wrote on the last version, and must be wondering why I would ignore his comments like that, and be pissed off that I was forcing him to write the same comments all over again, wasting his time, and just being stupid.'  That was the basic gist of the story I started to tell myself.  And maybe that's completely the case.  But probably my explanation that I attached the wrong file will make sense, and instead he can just think I'm too stupid to attach the right file.  Which is less damning than being too stupid to make the changes I've been asked to make.  So I'll take that.    I'll find out in the morning whether this is a fire-able offense.  I'm guessing not.  But, hey, you never know.  Stay tuned... :)      ",male

"       What I hate even more than the fact that these so-called Subway sandwich 'artists' give Erik shit whenever he asks them to change their tuna-fishy gloves is that they are stingy.  It took some work on my part to convince Erik that we should have Subway for lunch today instead of going home for toast. (Could that be any more depressing?) So I wanted the meal (deal) to live up to my arm twisting.  As some of you, namely Cate, have heard me tell time and again, one of the first times I knew Erik was the guy for me was when we went out for Subway in London. While I was busy marvelling over the absence of banana peppers and the presence of corn, I heard Erik make a little dissatisfied grunt. I looked over to see him motioning with his hand to the 'artist' behind the counter, 'Could you evenly distribute those cucumbers?' Or something to that effect. I stopped my ordering, looked over at him with dewey eyes and thought, 'love.' Four years later he's ordering horseradish sauce and I'm all, 'Is this the man I fell in love with?'  Anyway, I've accepted the fact that no Subway franchise will ever live up to the Oberlin establishment. Those townies knew how to make a sandwich! But the Subway here in Malmö is truly a disappointment. Like I said,  stingy . Today, after receiving a pittance of lettuce, I asked for more peppers. And then I had to ask for more than two olives and then as the 'artist' reached for a pickle, I said exasperated, 'Can I just have more of everything?'* It was all I could do not to climb over the glass case and make it myself. What do they think is in a veggie delight if it's not the veggies? In the end, once I sat down with my chips, my sub, and my fanta, the meal came together nicely.  About twenty minutes after lunch, while digesting in H&amp;M, I realized I forgot to ask for my subclub stamps.

"       i just wrote the silliest, lamest little email to craig thompson.  carnet de voyage  was just lovely--i liked the informality of the sketchbook, but the story of his travels across france and morocco was compelling enough to keep me reading past my bedtime (hey, i got up at 6:30 and i'm sleepy!). and of course his drawings are all so beautiful; i selfishly wondered if he sells his original art so i could try and save up and hoard one little bit all to myself.     and his impressions of the loneliness of traveling were just so spot on. i kept thinking back to my week in egypt when i was 20, and how lonely and miserable i was, even though i was traveling with friends. not being able to communicate well makes one feel more isolated, i guess.     back to craig thompson for a second though: i just suddenly remembered that when kris and damon (comic swap! i miss you!) recommended his book  goodbye, chunky rice , it was just before i went to israel. i remember rereading it in pittsburgh a day or so before i flew away . . . for the triangle denizens: i've seen copies at internationalist books and think you all should check it out. i hadn't seen it in years and finally found it in one of the boxes my parents brought me, along w/ all the stuff i got at the upc thing at bowling green when i'd just gotten back after 6 months abroad . . . i was so happy to read it again.  and i finally got my copy of  blankets  back too, from its endless rounds among my friends.  that one has a spot on my real bookshelves.    it makes my heart hurt a little to read his books, b/c he sometimes seems so sad; his drawings are so gorgeous that they hurt me a little too.  i'm profoundly grateful that he's out there creating these things though. i told him in my email that i bet every girl who reads his stuff falls a little bit in love with him, and i sincerely believe that it's true. maybe it's true of the sensitive males too, or of anyone who has experienced love and loss and loneliness and all that alliterative jazz.    yes, i'm aware that i take these things too seriously.

"           'Please understand my reasons for not speaking today. I am participating in the Day of Silence, a national youth movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. My deliberate silence echoes that silence, which is caused by harassment, prejudice, and discrimination. I believe that ending the silence is the first step toward fighting these injustices. Think about the voices you are not hearing today. What are you going to do to end the silence?'  ~The card I carried today to explain to my teachers why I couldn't answer questions in class.   This was such a weird experience, not talking for a whole day. It felt really isolated, as I guess it should. A lot of people didn't talk to me because I couldn't answer. People accepted it though, and I invented some 'sign language' so I could be understood. I wrote lots of notes, especially to teachers.  But it was so hard. Talking is just my nature. If I can't talk I get bored. I had a couple of slip-ups in classes where I always talk.  For example, I got lost in the music we're playing in band so I turned to John and said 'where...?' before I realized my mistake.  Gym class was the biggy... I talked at least three times during that class. For some reason swimming makes me need to talk.  When the fire alarm went off before I had changed out of my suit I swore. A couple times, pretty loud. But other than that I was good.  I'm definitely doing it again next year.         ",female

"             My days have been going so fast, that when I look back to see what I've done in every single one of them, I really can't believe it... Take this past friday for example, I had a meeting in the morning about some business, then another one at 12, then visiting 2 companies, then another meeting at 4, and then one at 8, and going to a bar at 11... he he he... of course, a lot of interesting things happened in all of those talks!!!... It's just that, man, living like this is kind of fun, since there is so much to do, my days are so full of experiences!... he he he...   Anyway, some of the highlights deal with businesses, and how, just when I was wondering how to make all the money that I needed, I was invited by one of the leaders in mexico to be a part of a huge international company, and start making some good cash on short term, and some huge cash on the longer run. I like that!... he he he... I think I may comment a lot more on that, in some other post... maybe. he he he.  Then again, one of the coolest parts happened on friday night. Victor, Kike, and I were wearing suits and all, because we went to a formal business meeting. But afterwards we just wanted to have fun in a bar. We were with Ireri, and then Blanco joined our party. The fun part was that blanco and ireri were very casual, and us three were super formal, with black suits, black shirts and all. So right before we came into the bar, we decided to make a formation:  Blanco and ireri were going to go as couples, and us three were acting as bodyguards... we looked serious, and even dangerous (believe it or not). Then we were doing this formations to go check everything out, then ask them to come, then wait, check the place out, etc. The minute we walked into the bar, everybody noticed us, guys and gals... the waiters got all nervous, and I don't think we have ever had such great service in our lives.   Of course Blanco was asked if we were his bodyguards, he said 'yes' and then all the waiters were afraid of us... he he he. They gave them a huge table, (one for about 6 to 7 people), just for them two!. Of course victor, kike and I kept standing all the time. When we were asked if we wanted a drink we said 'no' of course... and it's incredible!. They cleaned their table about 6 times, asked them every 5 minutes if everything was ok, and EVERYONE couldn't keep looking at us into our eyes!!... Even the hugest meanest guy would turn his face down the minute he made eye contact with me!!... he he he.  Of course lots of things happened... and it was fun... actually kind of a 'social experiment'... great night...   Then yesterday I attended to what probably was the hugest wedding in my life... it lasted from 1pm to 1am... they served us great food!, and a great dinner too!... about 4 bands played, one with 'covers' and cool music, and then a couple of Banda, of of them being 'Banda San Miguel' or something like that... which I was told is kind of famous... they had 'il caffetto' serving coffee, and ice cream stands, great drinks, the place was awesome, and the dancing was a lot of fun!!!... yay!... he he he... I was so tired this morning that I woke up till after 12... yikes. (still, the night before the weeding I slept only 3 hours, because we arrived home at about 2, and I woke up at almost 5 to work on inking and having the page done by 8, to take it to Eve's house).

"             Moore asks us to look at the following list of inconsistent beliefs, and revise the set to be consistent. He is, of course, correct in pointing out that logic only demands that the set be revised and not which particular beliefs be thrown out to do the revision.  (1) All knowledge is thus and so.  (e.g. Nothing counts as knowledge unless you couldn’t be wrong about it in any possible circumstances)  (2) Alleged knowledge of hands, etc., is not thus and so.  (e.g. it would be false if we were brains-in-a-vat and that is a possible circumstance)  (3) I know this is a hand.  So what do you throw out? (1) and (2) together are inconsistent with (3), so one has to go. Moore claims we should throw out the belief we have the least confidence in. Which could hardly be (3). In fact, Moore claims there is no argument we could give that throwing out (3) would be the more sensible move.   How do we feel towards this claim of Moore’s? Has he proven we have two hands?

Of course, my interest in all things Osborne has risen dramatically since their reality TV show but music is music and sometimes you just don't like it no matter how much you might want to.

"       ...everyone here is nuts.  (Insert hars hars hars here.)  So, yeaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Long week.  LONGGGGGGGGGGGG. I've decided to skip the synopsis and go straight for the non-sequiturs.    I'm currently very smelly.  I am smelly like a cab driver.  This is because I slept at Lindsay's last night, and all of my stuff was at Tammy's (my sister's).  Matt, myself, Brandon and Lindsay had what I like to refer to as a 'dysfunctional double date' last night, and ended up watching Almost Famous in her basement and drinking beer out of plastic Ohio State cups probably left over from some sporting event.  All four of us are listed in the official team roster as 'on a break,' which we celebrated by hanging out all week as much as possible...strange but a great time was had by all.  I learned three main things from last night's events, other than that the four of us think 'break' means 'spend every second together.'  Firstly, barbeque chips are apparently 'white trash chips,', while regular chips are not.  Secondly, if you make Matt stand in a UDF for more than 10 minutes, he begins to have some sort of undefinable attack best described as a coronary 'event.'  It's like making my dad stand still for longer than ten minutes...no dice.  Matt was making comments to the UDF counter girl like 'we're just going to hang out here all night if that's okay with you!'...this was prompted by lindsay's inability to decide between Smirnoff Ice and Smirnoff Cranberry.  Brandon made some sort of comment like 'when I finally get to UDF, and get the spoon to my ice cream, I'm going to stab you in the throat with it,' to Lindsay for a similar indiscretion, but failed to live up to this idle threat.  Matt paid for my white trash chips, Linds got the S. Ice, Brandon and I got ice cream, and life made sense again...as much as it has this week.  The final thing I learned is that the guys' reaction to discovering that 'Behind the Music: Guns and Roses' is on is similar to Megan and I's reaction when we find Model Behavior on the Disney Channel.  A lot of excited high pitched screaming and positioning onseself as close as physiologically possible to the TV screen.  I also learned that Slash's heart once stopped in a hotel from a drug overdose, and they had to pump adrenaline straight into his stopped heart to start it again.  We almost lost Slash.  WAY too scary to think about.  So yeah, I ended up staying at Lindsay's, until this morning when the Huges and us went to breakfast.  This is our name for the guys, because they are both physically large and large in personality.  Also they call one another this, and we picked it up..it's a nice mix of an affectionate and demeaning nickname, and it just FITS.  I'll give you some examples.  'Did Huge call?' 'What is WRONG with the two Huges?' 'Huge! Pass me my white trash chips or I will throw this Smirnoff Ice in your face.'  Ok, on to other things...I need to shower before Huge calls, I think we're hanging out after they get done with band stuff.  (See?  Bad at breaks.)  Actually, maybe I should stay smelly, it might effectively deter romance.    Other items of note:  It's Sarah Filipiak and her brother Ben Scragg's birthday!  They are collectively something like 49 years old.  That's almost Ravi's age. :)  It's also my parents' 41st wedding anniversary today.  Way to go...41 years and no breaks.  Maybe they have similar tastes in chips.  I'll have to remember to ask their secret.    My blog has won its first award....remember that blog I wrote about JMraz?  Well I'm on his street team, and they had some sort of promo to see who could come up with the most creative promo for him, and apparantly that won, so I get a JMraz baseball T that I've been lusting over for a year, and a CD for free.  Yay for street teams, JMraz, Elektra, free things, and baseball t's (my favorite kind!)  Yes, Megan, you may borrow it, but not sleep with it.  I got a FANTASTIC belt today by trading in some unwanted items at Rag-O-Rama, my favorite thrift store ever.  The belt features some nice Confederate flag-with-wings detailing, and a nice large red and white eagle with an American flag belt buckle.  Basically my belt is confused as to whether it wants to seceed from my pants.  I got about ninety comments about it today, none of which thankfully were 'I hate them darkies too.' (I'm glad everyone understood the irony of the belt.)  If anyone has access to a vinyl store, you should go in and find 'brothers and sisters' by the Allman Brothers, and just open it to see the centerfold picture.  You should be wearing some sort of protective eyegear to shield you from all of the moustaches.  Ok, i think that's it.  Ohio is its usual glorious self.  I will have to blog about my 14 hours in the airport and all of the strife therafter a little later.  For now its time for a shower, some quality time with Tam, and maybe, just maybe a little Huge.  Megan, I am so jealous of your Leo encounter.  I would have coughed 'the Beach sucked' and tripped him on his bike though.  I LOVE Leo, but it was THAT bad.  I miss you roommate.  See you tomorrow.  Hearts to all.         ",female

           O Paul! I read the Da Vinci Code! It's a GREAT book. I recommend it to everyone. The different hidden symbols found in the artwork and the secret organization of the Priory of Sion is just so interesting. However if you do read it I recommend you go online and look at some of the paintings discussed in the book. This will give you a good visual of what's described in the book. It's very entertaining and it allows you to explore new ideas. It's also fun to try to solve the different puzzels throughout the book.          ,male
"       So since this is a revival of my old blog I thought I would re-introduce myself.  I am a young single gal living in, well, sometimes it feels like the middle of nowhere, but really it's a great little town on Alberta Canada.  Single you ask?  Why yes, because of many things out of my control, I am single, and deeply confused by the new deal I am in.  The man I was with, the man I thought I would spend the rest of my life with is now officially not a nice man at all.  How could I have been so blind you ask?  Well, that will come with time...  I work for a corporation which shall remain nameless.  It is great in a lot of respects, but no one ever starts out saying 'Hmmm, I hope I grow up to work for 'the Man' someday...'  At least I didn't.  But I did make some fabulous friends and have had some great experiences.  Let me back track I guess.  A year ago, I was living in Toronto.  Yes, I know, Toronto.  Home of the Leafs, comedy, Muchmusic and Mike Meyers.  It was in alot of ways great, but I was hooped in a lot of ways too.  And then my ex-boyfriend came back from Jamaica, and I apparently lost my nerve to make it on my own, and came back to be with him.  I must have lost my mind.  Anyways, that is a whole other story.  I moved back to Alberta, where I got a good job (read :better paying) and moved back to my home town.  It was like Northern Exposure.  I forgot what it was to live in this city, or again, I must have lost my mind.  But regardless, it gave me just enough perspective to realize that this man was not for me.  And it's not that he was entirely bad, he wasn't entirely good either.  It just never felt quite right.         ",female

"           I went to see Spiderman 2 with two of my friends, it was a spur of the moment thing.  I neglected to inform my parents, who are 1,000 miles away of this.  Sure, if they are around I'd leave a note saying that I took a car and where I was, however I figured that if they were in a state hours away by plane that I didn't need to update them on my every move.  I was wrong.  They called my cell phone twice during the movie (which I put on vibrate thankfully) and according to the call records here, called the home phone twice and my personal line at least once.  I, being the responsible person I am, called them immediately after the movie was over.  My dad picked up, and demanded to know where I was.  I told him I had gone to see a movie with two of my friends.  'You told mom that you weren't going anywhere three hours ago.' 'I know, and right after I was invited to this.  I don't plan these things weeks in advance.' 'You should have called us to tell us where you were going!' 'I'm not a convict!  I don't need to report my whereabouts every two hours!' 'I know your not a convict, Ross.'  He handed the phone to my mom.  She asked me how I was doing, and I explained where I had been.  'Well, we just get worried, it's night and all.' 'Well mom, I know that you thought that someone had invaded the house and kidnapped me and then horribly mutilated my body before dumping it in a trashcan somewhere.  I'm calling to tell you that's not the case.' She paused for a minute.  'Well, alright.  Call us when you get home.'  Besides, if I had been in an accident, what could these people have done?  They are hours away by plane, and if the airline's performance on the flight down was any indication, it would be a day before they would arrive back here.  Better to let them enjoy the rest of their vacation without worrying about me.         ",male

"   by: Notorious Lee  In their classic party anthem 'Hey Mr. DJ,' Zhane grooves,  'Hey Mr. D.J./You can get this started Everybody's ready to party/ All night, all night/ All the girls are  ready/So we can all get to it So we can party 'till the break of dawn, ohhhhh.'   This simple song's sing-a-long lyrics (and not to mention it's themes of dancing fever that are infectiously double X chromosome) really hits it on the head about the very complexities, conflicts, and pressures that a dj deals with. It also shows how djing is very much about politics as it about gettin low.  Sat. nite, I had honor of djing with the Fat Guy crew at Club Sno-Drift  in San Francisco. Preferring Hip-hop from 1988-1995, waxin' nostalgia through the ages of  afrocentricity to ghettocentricity, the Fat Guys want to reach out to people who really love the music. It sounds simple, because it really is.  People like to go out/clubbing for a lot of reasons (I will explore more later), but for these folks, they want to hit up  people who feel this style of music because of the imprints it's left on their brains and  that really set the tone of a particular moment of their life.  But back to the party... The party was a lot of fun.  Despite the fact that the place was about 1/2 as crowded as it usually is at their events, it was still a lot of fun for me (and i think for others) cuz we played the music that meant a lot to ourselves (personally) and to the whole idea of Fat Guy in general.  But the crowd there mildly gyrated to the classic jams, with quite a few of the pole fanatics asking for 2pac, Keak Da' Sneak, and as one girl requested, 'Reggae.. you know the 'dancing' reggae.. not that other reggae.' That comment perfectly leads into my point.  People always try to categorize Hip-hop... from the backpackers to the more radio-friendly people...they're always trying to answer 'What is 'real' Hip-hop?'  This post isn't going to be part of that never-ending debate about Hip-hop authenticity because that's so Nelson George and early Hip-hop studies. This post is more about the challenges of i guess 'Hip-hop djing' and how 'hip-hop' authenticity can really piss off a dj and fuck up his nite when he goes to spin at a 'Classic Hip-hop' party.         Girls mostly go to the clubs and dance.  'Hey Mr. Dj' says it perfectly... to get the party started, you need the girls.  Girls love to dance... and guys will only dance with girls (well, not always.. but agree for the sake of my point) otherwise they're just 'leaning back.' So to get girls to dance you gotta play the 'dancing music' that the ladies love.  It's a domino affect.. or chaos theory or  somethin like that.  But what constitutes the right 'dancing music'?  To most, this only consists of recent radio.  When i invited people to the event, some commented 'well, is that music you can really dance to?' 'It's the good Hip-hop right?' or 'Your gonna play dancing Hip-hop right? Cuz you can't really dance to old stuff.'  So comments like that assume that in hip-hop's yesteryear, people didn't dance at all....  I've been to events where the dj has been terrible, where snares and kicks are layered on top of each other between transitions that it sounds like your listening to the song in an echo chamber.  But people hella feel the dj because he played a Lil Jon superset or he played that one song that's hot at that moment.  To the average listener, a dj's 'skills' are often judged not so much by the technicality of spinning but more by if he can play the right music that will make you dance.  I'm going to loosely quote from 'F' 'Nobody really cares what you play, because as long as people dance all nite, they'll bemhappy.  Nobody cares if your bpms are matched up, cuz you could mix off, but if that next song drives them crazy that's all that matters.'  Many of my other dj friends will corroborate with this.  And that comment is very much true.. if your the cleanest mixer, but can't play the right music, then hell ya your gonna be a shitty dj.  But depending on the venue, it's more often than not, the dj is under some extreme pressures to play to the crowds taste, to get the party started and hittin till 6 in the morning.  Which leads to some other 'politics' of djing.    Partying is basically business.  Well, at least for promoters and club owners. Sure they want you to have a good time, but really, they want you to spend money on drinks.. Most probably already know this, but i'll just reintroduce it anyway.  Sometimes when throwing parties, promoters have to pay off the bar tab which can be anywhere from hundreds to thousands.  So you basically owe the bartab before you make any money at the door.  For instance, at Saturday's gig, the bar tab was 5,000 dollars off  alcohol.  The first couple parties that Fat Guy through there, they made close to 8000 dollars just on drinks alone.  that's a pretty fatty profit for them for their 4-5 hours of work.   And what is it that people want to feel? 'crunk'  Lil Jon's style has set off a new style of music making that involves all the sounds that just makes you want to get angry.  But to get to that next level, it involves crunk juice...y'know.. the alcohol to really set it off.  People always seem to say that 'oh i need alcohol to really be uninhibited.' or 'I'll dance once i have a few drinks.'  So in essence, its really 'not' all about the music....  Cuz i think if it was all about the music, people wouldn't really need to feel loaded up on alcohol as much as say a major club party.  Well, okay.. fat guy did make quite a profit at the other parties tho... right?  True.  They're parties have been off the hook. But take San Jose's Agenda as a perfect example.  Agenda was the spot last summer for less than a minute.  The promoters on thursday nite through a party called 'Stank' which would bring in some of the most famous djs and music producers in Hip-hop's past and present.  And their music sets were often the umbrella term 'old school Hip-hop/Classic Hip-hop.'  I went to the first one with Questlove and that one was fuckin  ridiculous.  I had to wait in line for over half an hour and every level and area of the place was packed.  I mean, damn, everyone there was having a good time, and the girls were hella coo too!  I didn't get rejected once!  But the hype slowly died afterwards.  From what I heard, even with Pete Rock and Mr. Choc, the place just wasn't packed.  I went on the last nite, and it loosely packed with b-boys forming circles and girls in j.lo hats.  It looked more like a middle school dance more than anything.  But what is noticeable is that neighboring clubs started with new parties too which played more current jams.  In addition these folks were all in dressy attire.. meaning they probably have $ or faking that they have $. Maybe 'classics' just doesn't have the staying power.. but I think it's the lure of a certain style of music that really sets everything off on a larger scale...  So to be a dj on a bigger scale often means a lot of politicking.  Not just 'skills' but thinking about the girls and future gigs...its the common story about 'selling out.' When i first started djing, i was helluva a backpacker, and when people asked me if wanted to dj their party i said 'oh, i only play underground, and im not into that sort of thing.'  Then of course i realized the perks of djing, ya know.. money, cash, h**, and i only bought radio compilations... but i mean, if i had it my way NOW, i'd be playing neo-soul and jazzed out Hip-hop (mainstream or 'underground') all the time, playing the likes of Allison Crocket, Dwele, D'Angelo, Cooley's Hot Box, and such  Being a dj, at least in a club, is really not as glamorous as it seems.  It's fun when girls are throwing themselves at you after you play some of that 'dancing' reggae (versus the 'other' reggae) and when people are have a great time humping the magic stick  (the poles) too.  But djing can often mean sacrificing a lot to expose sides of your music  tastes that are usually unheard... then there is always the potential threat that the folkers aren't feelin your vibe.  Im not just talking about not getting to the club before guestlist ends, but there is always a price to pay for having fun on the promotion side of the party.  So heres my advice for you aspiring djs: Don't quit your day jobs. ",female
"       Don, I hope you don't mind me posting this, but after this email, I think I need to clear up exactly what I was saying.  I'm also very happy to hear that you are getting your life together.    Email starts -   not sure if I understand your position on Rush's alleged addition. You say  How could he do something so stupid. What are you talking about. His  addiction, petty drug dealing or his brazen behavior. As of late I am  becoming a bit of an expert on addiction and recovery. I have a problem with  alcohol. It's cost me a lot. It's taken me 15 years to figure that out.  If  Rush is an addict(he kicked smokes) it may take him something like this to  say 'Hey I have a drug problem' An addict does not realize they are addicts.  The thought process is fucked up. All we care about is when, where and how.  He chose pain killers. I don't know the whole story but if he is truly  addicted then he needs help and lets hope he gets it. Step one is a tuff  step to take. We admit we are powerless over 'drug of choice'and that our  lives had become unmanageable. I've admitted it but I have not accepted it.  I've got 11.5 steps to go. If true, you can see the unmanageable part of his  life, illegal acts. Whether it be alcohol, cocaine, heroin, sex, Rx drugs or  gambling it's a disease. If you don't believe that get hooked and try to get  off. Don't let the bad truth shatter your connection with him. We are only  human,(unless you believe the aquatic ape theory) we are hypocrites, we have  faults, as long as we are willing to make amends to those we have harmed  then we're moving in the right direction. Shit Robert Downy Jr. was given  the poor little rich Hollywood actor bit(media treatment) can't we somehow  make that defense fit for Rush. Poor formally huge right wing conservative talk radio show host awful tie  wearing NFL analyst with formally nicotine stained fingers Snapple drinking  Spatula city ad man. Ya think that will work.  End Email  My potential anger with Rush comes from the stupidity of his actions (assuming that he has done what the allegations claim - notably: purchasing drugs from street thugs, buying thousands of pills at a time, relying on a housekeeper as a supplier and so on.)  Someone of his profile simply cannot engage in this kind of behaivor and expect to not get caught.  People talk, especially low life dealers when they get caught.  Now, that isn't to say I condone the addiction so long as he is careful about his supply.  I can understand an addiction, and I don't know how the man suffered during his cochlear implant.  I've read that it can be an excruciating thing to go through.  Pain Killer addiction is somewhat easy to get tangled up in, from what I've read.  It bothers me, if true, that Rush did not seek help immediately.  He has it all.  A dream life, success, and a job he loves.  And he has placed it at risk, when help was a phone call away.  If he found himself hooked, all he had to do was call his doctor, take a medical leave, and then come back and tell us about his exercise in personal responsibility.    I am saddened when someone I admire becomes addicted, but I don't get angry unless that individual recognizes a problem and makes no effort to get help.    So I guess that is the root of my possible trouble with Rush.  I've never been addicted, so maybe I don't understand.  All I would hope for is that he gets himself fixed up if he has a problem.  If he got involved in a criminal enterprise, then I am going to have a harder time getting over it.           ",male

If you didn't, go check them out, and maybe you can feel a little glow of satisfaction when the next update comes. If you've been watching from the sidelines, wanting to do your part, this is an excellent group. They work hard, they keep it real, and the overhead is minimal. What you give them, they put to work.   From: Dunham Maj Oliver H  Sent: Monday, June 28, 2004 6:12 AM To: Jim Hake Cc: Lutkenhouse LtCol John F; Chandler Maj Thomas E  Subject: sewing center  Dear Jim,  The local TV station we have been supporting with your donated media gear did a news spot on the new sewing center that opened in Ramadi. The station did a 14 minute segment set to music, with interviews of different people interspersed throughout the segment.  The center has actually been expanded into what the Iraqis are calling a 'Women's Center' (the sign reads in English below the Arabic, 'The Organization of Creative Women in New Iraq'). The Iraqis will be planning use profits generated from the sewing to fund women's education (English, computer skills, etc). This is huge and is exactly the direction we are trying to drive things as it runs counter to the agenda of the extremists who are fighting to keep this part of the world mired in the dark ages. During the segment, they panned to new furniture (purchased by us), school-type desks and new computers (I believe provided by CPA), and of course, the sewing machines set up on tables, each one being its own sewing station. They are saying that 900 families will be supported by the center though I think that may be a little bit of an overstatement as locals here are sometimes apt to do.  That said, the Iraqis had a true ribbon cutting ceremony.  There was a darling little girl who was holding one end of the ribbon while a man cut the ribbon. One of the Iraqis interviewed (I believe he is the director of the center) thanked the Governor for the assistance that made the center possible.  Because we are approaching the transfer to sovereignty there was no Coalition involvement in the opening of the center.  Thus, though the Coalition was not mentioned; we still see this as a win. Any time the interim government gets credit for something that benefits local people, it increases support for the interim government.  Support for the interim government means greater stability, which is what we need to get Iraq through the transition period.   There is still a fight here, but we are making progress.  Thanks again for the help.  Holden         ",male

Pendant les premières saisons, il y avait une leçon morale dans chaque épisode et j'ai adoré ça et oui, je sais bien que les soeurs étaient assez promiscue dans ces premières épisodes qu'aujourd'hui et que la sorcellerie n'est pas morale.

"       I am an pedant.  Here is my newest criticism.  Some movies will list actors in some not immediately apparent order, and qualify the list thus: 'In no particular order.'  Why do they do this?    Probably because some actors would get upset about being placed lower than they think their importance would suggest.  So 'In no particular order' is a cheap excuse; it's according to no criterion of value, so we didn't deliberately slight you.  But the very reason an objection would come up is that, while not in an obvious order (like alphabetical), the actors are in  some particular order !  They must always be in some particular order.  If it were possible to actually put them in no particular order, there would be no need to qualify the presentation with that absurd phrase.  Summary:  The reason it says 'In no particular order' is precisely because that is not true.  In no important order, or in no good order, or in random order might be more accurate.         ",male

Don't get me wrong...a little spice in life is nice, but why do we have to constantly hurt each other (or talk behind each other's back)?  We constantly have a desire to dish each other.  I look at the example of a pride event that I attended last weekend.  The purpose of the whole event was to celebrate who we are as a family.  It was really nice seeing our community come together at such an event and be able to be who we really are.  I also notice the dark side to the event.  We all were constantly reviewing each other and critiquing other men.  Why do we do this?  I really think that it is a defense mechanism for us so that the attention is not upon us.  If we ridicule another person, maybe everyone else will not look at me!  Hmmmm                 ",female
"                 On my bro's cd i found this. There was piano and some sort of orchestra in the backround as this was said.   Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word, fuck. Out of all the English words that begin with the letter f, fuck is the only word referred to as the f-word. Its the one magical word that, just by itself, can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from the German word, ficken, which means to strike. In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories. As a transitive verb for instance, ‘John fucked Shirley‘, as an intransitive verb, ‘Shirley fucks‘. Its meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective such as ‘Johns doing all the fucking work‘, as part of an adverb, ‘Shirley talks too fucking much‘, as an adverb enhancing an adjective, ‘Shirley is fucking beautiful‘, as the object of an adverb, ‘Shirley is fucking beautifully‘, as a noun, ‘I don’t give a fuck‘, as part of a word, ‘abso-fucking-lutley‘, or, ‘in-fucking-credible‘, and as almost every word in a sentence, ‘fuck the fucking fuckers‘. As you may realize, there are very few words with the versatility of fuck. As in these examples describing situations, such as, fraud. ‘I got fucked at the used car lot’. Dismay. ‘Aw, fuck it’. Trouble. ‘I guess I'm really fucked now‘. Aggression. ‘Don’t fuck with me, buddy‘. Difficulty. ‘I don’t understand this fucking question‘. Inquiry. ‘Who the fuck was that?’ Dissatisfaction. ‘I don’t like what the fuck is going on here‘. Incompetence. ‘He's a fuckoff‘. Dismissal. ‘Why don’t you go outside and play hide-and-go-fuck-yourself?’. I'm sure you can think of many more examples. With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use this word? We say use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech. It will identify the quality of your character immediately, so say it loudly and proudly, 'FUCK YOU'.  I found it quite humorous as well (mostly because of how serious the guy sounded as the music played in the backround), but if you feel differently (i.e. you are offended by this) then I apologize here.

"           Damn, didn’t I used to write for this disturbing genital sore of a website? It’s been way too long…   Anyways, some quick updates, and then a little bit o’postin’ for the chillins.  First off, I’m sure you’ve heard the rumors about BEER AND PORN RADIO, and I’m here to tell you that they are TRUE. BEER AND PORN RADIO is in the works, and we’re hoping to bring the same depraved, offensive commentary to you in audio form sometime in the next few months. How will it work, you ask? The stream will be broadcast from the Internet on demand, meaning you’ll be able to listen to each episode at your own leisure, whenever you wish! Most importantly, the stream will be FREE! That’s right, no need to scour porn and warez sites looking for Beer n Porn MP3s – just follow the links from right here on the site and your virgin ears will be basted in the love juice we call social commentary. Check the site often for more details.  Second, we’ve recently added a new feature to BEER AND PORN. If you look above the posts you’ll see a link for the BEER AND PORN MESSAGE BOARDS. Here’s your chance to interact with others who waste their time reading Beer and Porn, along with the depraved souls who author the crap you read here every day! It’s free to sign up, and within minutes you’ll be trading sexually explicit jokes with the rest of us here at Beer and Porn! A word of caution – nothing on the board is censored, so if you have a weak soul or are prone to being offended, it’s best if you move on to something a little more tame, like the Disney online store or something. Otherwise, we’d love to have you!  Third, it’s time for a little shout out. We’re always excited to hear about Beer and Porn fans from around the globe. Your pal and mine, Mr. Dexter Otis Green, has done a fan-freakin-tastic job of tracking our readership across the globe. Recently, he identified the FIRST INSTANCE OF A PERSONAL WEBSITE LINKING TO BEER AND PORN! This is a monumental, historic moment in the annals of the Internet. Not only are people reading this tripe, but they are coming back, and they are TELLING THEIR FRIENDS! I am flush with pride and arrogance!  [DRUM ROLL, PLEASE]  Congratulations, AILIN from NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA! We’ve found your Beer and Porn link on your fantastic, award-winning webpage, and we’re here to say thanks! You are just the first step towards our eventual conquest of Canada, which we will use as the base for our global empire! You have earned yourself a high-ranking position in our eventual ruling government thanks to your obedience to the Beer and Porn movement! Har-har-har-ha! [Maniacal laughter and the twitching of fingers follows].  Seriously, Ailin, much appreciated. Drop us a line if you read this. Until then kiddies, visit her  urlLink website  and  urlLink weblog  and let her know how amazingly cool she is.   Moving on to the important stuff… Finally, the results of the last poll!    Who is -The Man?-   Whitey 130 (56%)   Jesus 6 (2%)   Whitey Pig Cops 8 (3%)   Ron Jeremy 17 (7%)   My mom, sadly. 69 (30%)   230 Total votes     Oh Jesus, you just couldn’t cut it this time, huh? Sadly, the Son of God himself couldn’t pull more than 2% of the overall vote. We tried to reach Mel Gibson for comment, but he was too busy counting the millions he made from preying on the devotion of the faithful to sell movie tickets to respond to our questions. Way to go Mel! If you’re such a good Christian, why don’t you donate all those profits from the “Passion” to charity? I’m sure that $200 million will help you buy a nice comfy Lay-Z-Boy at the right hand of Jesus when you’re finally called from this Earth, huh?  Does anyone honestly think it’s a coincidence that “Passion” was released around Ash Wednesday to coincide with the Easter season? That’s marketing, kids.   Coming in fourth was “Whitey Pig Cops,” which surprisingly only pulled 3% of the vote. I expected a little more voting love for the jerkoffs who continue to make the parking lots and side streets of the world safe with useless tickets while criminals are allowed to roam the streets raping, robbing and killing. Seriously. Ever see a bunch of cops eating lunch at a local restaurant, or grabbing coffee somewhere in the middle of the day? Ever want to just grab them by the throat and yell “Hey buddy, how about getting in your damn Pigmobile over there and SOLVING A FEW CRIMES WHILE YOU EAT THAT DANISH????” Ever want to slash the tires of a dumb-ass cop who’s pulled over someone for a minor traffic violation in the middle of rush-hour traffic, backing up cars for miles? Ever wonder why police only need a high school education to get a job? COPS ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND. THEY ARE NOT THERE TO PROTECT YOU. THEY ARE ONLY THERE TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO.  Sorry, that wasn’t very funny. But I hate cops. Moving on.  In third place was my man, Ron Jeremy. Ron pulled 7% of the vote, beating Jesus by 11 votes, and again proving that Beer and Porn readers are the smartest readers of all. Ron Jeremy is the unsung hero of the American Porn Industry, which grosses more money per year than Hollywood. This is the honest truth. Pornography funnels millions of dollars in tax revenue into state and federal coffers every year, and silently allows media conglomerates to make profits. The porn industry is also responsible for many technological advances, such as the VCR, DVD, streaming video on the internet, encryption technology, and other high-tech methods of data transfer. Ron Jeremy, along with the other stars of the porn industry, we salute you! Not only did you get me through puberty, but you keep the American economy afloat! I’m going to celebrate with my Vivid DVDs…  In second place, we have your mom. I must say that I expected your mom to be the dark horse candidate, but she couldn’t put it all together in the end. I think we all know your mom’s qualifications in the area, and I think it’s safe to say that all of us here at Beer and Porn have an intimate relationship with your mom and her abilities. Your mom could be reached for comment, but we chose not to, because we aren’t interested in what she has to say, are we? We’re interested in what she can do…  Finally, the number one choice to the answer “Who is ‘The Man’?” – Whitey.  Speaking on behalf of Whitey, I’d like to make a brief acceptance speech.  I am probably the closest thing to the stereotypical Whitey that you can find. I’m white, for starters. Hopelessly white. Irish and Italian kind of white. Suburban Connecticut kind of white. Middle-middle class kind of white. Only child kind of white. The opposite of “diversity” kind of white. I put the “C” in Caucasian. I’m bland like Vanilla. I am the personification of Wonderbread. I fail to qualify for any scholarships. There are no outreach programs available to me. I am not protected by any equal opportunity mandates. I am not covered by any quotas. I am the reason for Affirmative Action. I have an albino soul. I am white.  I have been told from the day of my birth that I am bland and unoriginal. My ancestry is treated like potpourri trivia rather than a source of heritage or pride. My people, whoever they may be, are responsible for any and all social injustices you can find. I am responsible for slavery. I am responsible for patriarchy. I am responsible for the Jewish diaspora. I am responsible for the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere. I am responsible for political lines in Africa and the Middle East that have destroyed tribes and caused civil unrest. I am the face of the Ku Klux Klan, of the Know-Nothing party, of National Socialism, of the Spanish Inquisition and untold other instruments of intolerance and cruelty. I am Big Tobacco. I am Big Government. I am Big Oil. I am Rich Uncle Pennybags, with a cigar in my mouth and a top hat on my head, running the world thanks to my white male privilege.  I am told that I run the show, and therefore I deserve no breaks. I am expected to prostrate repeatedly for the sins of my ancestors. I am afforded no breaks, no helping hands and no compassion. If I succeed, it is because of my white male privilege. If I fail, it is my fault and no one else’s. I am not allowed to enter into discourse about society, because my views are inherently racist, sexist, classist and bigoted. I am the personification of the sins of the world.   I am white. I am apparently “The Man.”   ---------------------  It’s difficult to talk about such things without exposing your shortcomings in reasoning due to your position in society. One could look at my social stature and claim that I am a perfect example of white privilege: well educated, self-sufficient, soon to receive my graduate degree and become a member of professional academia. You could say that I’ve never had to struggle to reach my goals, or fight preconceived notions of my abilities based on societal stereotypes. I certainly couldn’t argue with you – all I know is my own experience, and I can’t say whether my path has been eased by my skin color and gender. Some would say that is the case – and who am I to argue?  This I think is the point of my ridiculous rant above. It’s certainly fair to say that there are inherent social benefits to being male, or white, or both, in modern society. And it is just as important to expose these unfair advantages for what they are, as everyone should be afforded the same rights and opportunities in a truly free society. However, it often feels that as a member of white male America, I am immediately shut out of these discussions because of my perceived bigotry and/or involvement with the problems in society. Can a grown man speak about Feminism? Can a white man talk about racism? I’d like to think so – but in Politically Correct America, I’m afraid this may not be the case.  Anyways, on behalf of all Whiteys everywhere, I’d like to apologize. We’re trying our best to do the right thing. We’re just not all that good at it. Blame the fall of the Roman Empire. It messed us up pretty good, you know.  -Mr. Carson           ",male

"           you see a lot of things in chelsea-- men in new levis made to look vintage and their tiny fitted t-shirts who can walk a catwalk better than any super model, boy butter, crazies talking to non-existent people, the occasional homeless person on fire.  But today I saw something I have never seen before.  I saw a dog walking on a leash with her owner who looked before she crossed the street.  Im not kidding, the dog looked to see if there were cars coming!! I was stunned!! Dogs are freaking smart when they wanna be.  Then there are my cats who are engaged in a WWE throw down at the moment.  Ha!  Ive seen a lot of wierd things today actually besides the above.  I saw what looked like should have been a respectable girl with a short skirt on that was so short, when she walked and it flipped up a little bit, you could see her ass.  Um, whoa!  I think she had a bathing suit on underneath, but unless you are at the beach, its much inappropriate.  I also saw a man dart of the salvation army store, scream, 'F*&ing Bastard!' and look both ways. I kept walking trying to avoid trouble.  I stop to wait to cross the street and who comes running up?  Crazy salvation army guy.  He's clutching his cell phone on his hip (if I didn't konw it was his cell phone, I would have thought it was a gun), he jumps INTO traffic, places his hand on a taxis hood and says, hold on a second (as if he were a super agent on a secret mission). He then proceeds to run for several blocks where I could not see him anymore.  I wanted to follow him to see what his problem was, but I wasn't going to  jump in front of on coming traffic or run in flip flops.   People are so funny.  Craig and I had brunch at a place in chelsea called Rue de Crepes.  which craig tells me means the street of crepes.

"       Greetings from Athens. Hundreds and hundreds of emails flood my inbox after each one of my pieces I write for this publication. Now, while most of them are praising me, asking for pictures, asking for dates, or are junk mail, there have been a few from music fans who think I have it plain wrong. To those folks all I have to say is: I do not have it wrong. You do. My opinions are so very true that they almost lose all semblance of being an opinion and kind of just jump right in step with fact. So don’t any of you dare question my authority and voice in this music world. All right? Good. Now that I have that off my back (which some say is the sexiest part of my body; I don’t know though, that is a tough tough question), time to review some music.  Went and saw Patterson Hood play a solo gig the other night. No, not that Patterson Hood, not the minor league ball player who is famous for striking out in his first 72 home plate appearances. I am talking about Patterson Hood: the rambunctious, story telling front man of the Athens-based band Drive-By Truckers. It wasn’t actually a solo gig; it was listed as Patterson Hood vs. Don Chambers. No, not that Don Chambers, not the former rightwing conservative Hawaiian delegate turned hot air balloon daredevil. I am talking about Don Chambers the cool, heavy guitar playing local rock star who digs playing loud. These were the two men that were pinned against each other in a bill labeled as 'Patterson Hood vs. Don Chambers.'  Who was going to win? How would the point system be set up? And most importantly, who was refereeing? Nah, just kidding. There was no battle, just two friends up on stage trading off songs. The drummer from the Truckers sat behind them playing a tiny little drum kit, while the two in front played some good ole southern guitars.  'Intimate' is how some would describe the Flicker Theater. Not Mad Mode though. She, who is I, would describe it as the hidden away living room that makes a closet feel large. It is so small that the amount of soul that the String Cheese Incident has produced in its entire career could easily fit in the room. So small, it is, that it makes the Caledonia seem big. It is so small that Dave Schools couldn’t even fit in the room.  Shortly after the show started, the single microphone (that Chambers and Hood had been passing back and forth between songs) was working on a 'when I want to' basis. The men on stage decided to do away with the mic and just sing loud, without any form of amplification. Patterson told a story that I will never forget about a childhood friend who snorted too much glue. (A taper taped it - not on tape - or perhaps on tape. I am not sure but at any rate, get this tape to hear this story.) The story wound up covering the gospel subject. Which led Don Chambers into playing a gospel song. The man played and sang with a sense of feeling I don’t think I have seen before. He sang and played with passion, while remaining in his cool stance. He came off as such a cool dude, he probably wouldn’t produce a drop of sweat in a summertime Mississippi kitchen. His voice was somewhat sheik while his guitar was loud and rugged.  When it was Patterson's turn he’d tell a story and then burst into the song about that story, which suddenly had much more meaning. He finished off the night with 'Sink Hole' (which will be on the new Drive-By Truckers album). 'Sink Hole' is typical of a Patterson song: gritty, twangy, real and fun. The kind of song that makes you down your drink, order another one, down that one and order a round for everyone sitting at the bar. His music makes you feel good about going out and getting hammered.  The crowd was an atypical Athens crowd. Spring break let all the kiddies go home to their mommies and daddies, or make arses of themselves in Panama City. What was left was a crowd who came to hear some good ole home brewed music. There was only one boy in the entire venue that wouldn't leave me alone. And he still won't leave me alone! (Chauncey, stop bothering me. Yes I know I am beautiful, yes I know I am hipper than any girl you have ever met, I have heard it all before! Leave me alone!)  While folks pealed out of the Flicker into the thick dropping rain pellets, I made my way up on yonder to a lil' hole in the wall bar that shall remain nameless, out of respect. The band that played there, to put it nicely, sucked. To put it bluntly: couldn’t carry a tune if it was put in a nice carrying case with handles and all. They called themselves 'Pittt Stopp,' but I called them 'Pleaseee Stopp.' This local arrangement consisted of two guitar players (just figuring out how to do bar chords), a bass player with smaller fingers than me, and a very beginner drummer. They attempted to cover the Grateful Dead's 'Eyes of the World,' but it turned out sounding like “Who Let the Dogs Out.” I kid you not. The terrible thing about it was that there were actually people dancing around, like it was good or something.  So my great night of music turned very sour, very quickly. But oh well.  Till next time, Madeline Modeliste  On an Athens Scale of 5, the Patterson Hood vs. Don Chambers show got a 3.89: three Cubano sandwiches from the tasty Cuban food joint, Caliente Cab; and the 89 cents that I found in JoMo’s couch while I interviewed him.  Pittt Stopp got a one. Only because they are from Athens, and only because I have a heart. They get one free music lesson each from anyone that'll give it to them. Even though they need much much more.         ",male

"                  Oh I Love a Rainy Night!   I love the sound of rain. There's something soothing about the sound of the earth being refreshed. It's almost as if while the earth soaks up the life-giving water my own soul participates in the watering. The wind starts whistling in the windows and the rain then begins slowly pelting on the roof. I hear the “ting-ting-ting” as each raindrop hits the top of the chimney. The speed of the rain picks up until you can’t identify a single raindrop, but it’s a continual sheet of rain. A car drives by and I hear the splash of the tires running through the puddles collected in the parking lot. What is it about rain that causes us to desire to slow down and want to curl up under a blanket with a book? Could it be that God created rain not just to refresh the earth and keep it green but also to refresh us from our hectic lives and give ourselves permission to slow down?               ",female

Tomorrow, we are attending a wedding shower/potluck dinner.  We are each supposed to be bringing a place setting which we have aquired from tag sales or thrift stores etc.  It is supposed to be fun and you try to bring the silliest setting, cheapest setting or whatever.  Still, for a family of 5, it just wears you out thinking of how you will get around to it.  We went to the thrift store the other day and Noah just picked out everything for us all.  I would not have chosen what he did, but then, I had to run around the store after a preschooler who wanted everything there.  So, we still have to find some forks somewhere.  Thrift stores never  have forks.  Hmmm...             ",female

"        it's a marvelous night for a lawsuit   Alex Beam has a great  urlLink article  in today's Boston Globe about Van Morrison trying to prevent an unauthorized biography of the cranky singer/songwriter from being published.   The book, entitled 'Can You Feel the Silence,' apparently paints Van the Man in a rather unflattering light. Now I've been a Van Morrison fan since way back when (1990, to be exact), and while I will be the first to admit that he's one of rock's most talented, accomplished and enduring figures, you have to admit -- he's not exactly known for being warm and cuddly.   If this book ever seees the light of day, you can bet I'll be checking it out. I'm all about rock star dirt. (Boston-area fans, take note: there's apparently a section in the book about Van's brief period as a resident of Cambridge in the late sixties).          ",male

A  New York Times  story refers to the war in Sudan as a 'pet cause of many American religious conservatives.'Imagine, writes Allen Hertzke, political scientist at the University of Oklahoma, the Times describing the plight of Soviet Jewry as a 'pet cause' of American Jews or apartheid in South Africa as a 'pet cause' of African Americans. For twenty years, the civil war in Sudan has killed two million people, displaced five million, and revived the slave trade. The war is between the Islamic regime in Khartoum and the mainly Christian south of Sudan. Under intense pressure from Christian human rights groups in this country, a pact has recently been signed that may end the war. One might think that would be headline news, but it is buried in the back pages, if it is reported at all. After all, it is only a pet cause of religious conservatives.                  ",female
